"6 Rue Blaise Desgoffe, 6th arr., 75006 Paris, France",Victoria Palace Hotel,"The last night on the 12.11.2024, the power system was doing maintenance for 2 hours between 1.00 and 3.00, so there is no power in the room or hotel. That means, no heating is on, no charging phones or laptop, no light in the room, you need to go to the bathroom blind:)) The problem is on cold nights, you need to know to get up at 3:00 AM to start the heating.,The toilet was separate from the shower and sink, so you have to go over to the other bathroom to wash your hands.,In the center courtyard of the building a ground level leasure area is available. Regretfully around 10:30pm -midnight there was a lot of loud talking and laughing, and rooms with inside facing doors had a lot of nuisance. Please close this area after 9pm!!!,I had a very bad experience with the masseuse‚Äîor rather, attempting to get a massage. I was still charged despite being made very uncomfortable by the masseuse himself. I do wish more information had been shared during the booking process.,N/A,Had courtyard/garden facing room and guests were smoking here which drift up and into the room 
Breakfast area crowded and fridges for cold stuff were at eye level so tricky to access,Everything was perfect except on the last day , there was a very rude chamber maid, he basically told my husband to get out of the room, even though we paid for late checkout,Nothing,Check in/Check out process. The reception area and staff greeting needs some work. Only 1 staff member was friendly and accommodating. She was helpful in our check out process. The gentleman that checked us in wasn‚Äôt very friendly and seemed a little confused at times. We assumed that he might be new and had patience. The other staff members seemed as though they couldn‚Äôt be bothered with guests. There seemed to have been a few hotel staff/managers on site hanging out on their laptops in the reception area but none would greet guests or be concerned whenever a guest was present. Thank heavens for the lovely lady who checked us out.,Nothing,That we didn't stay longer !!! our fault not the hotels, I gave it a 9/10 rating due to our short stay.,The only down side about the property is that it is just a bit on the outskirts of shopping and cafes. We had to walk about 1/2 mile to get to the heart of the 6th. Other than that, all else was great!,It was expensive,there was persistent noise throughout the day, both from the street and within the hotel, which made it difficult to relax.,The room was a little small but still very nice. There were no wash clothes. Is that a Paris thing?,n:a,That I had to leave to fo home.,Note to management: why did you guys decide to take away from the beauty of your lobby and install a huge eye sore ice cream machine? Why not put that in the bkfast area. It was such a turn off in my opinion. You did not have that before and it was so much better,Nothing,All good expect to much perfume in the entrance. Also some washing clothes,There was nothing to dislike.,Nothing,Because it was my first time in France, many of my activities and tours were in the first district, a fact I didn‚Äôt realize when I booked. Upon checking in, it would‚Äôve been helpful for the concierge to provide a map of where we are, where the closest metro is, and circle places like Louvre, Arch, Notre Dame and Eiffel Tower - along with nearby restaurant recommendations.,Beds and pillows weren‚Äôt very comfortable.,Hairdryer - could definitely use better hairdryers. This was the only downside honestly.,The fitness center was very nice with a great sauna, only small complaint was that the exercise bike could have been a bit better,Perhaps updated equipment in the gym.,Requested a room with a view of the Eiffel tower, room 702 got allocated to us and it did not disappoint, wow wow wow.,Bigger rooms for the cost,I loved everything,Nothing,Nothing,Nothing,Far from Olympic stadia and tourist spots,The beds were to hard,Not a great deal.
It was expensive but then it was the Olympics.
Probably could have done with larger lifts - we only had small cases so fine for us.,Nothing,All was perfect.,All was perfect.,Nothing!!!,Nothing,Lifts were a bit slow, probably darker and noisier if you‚Äôre on a lower floor (we were on the 6th which I would recommend),No drawer space for our clothes,I didn‚Äôt like how warm the room was. It was cooler than a previous hotel that I stayed in the night before.,Air con in rooms could have been cooler,rooms a bit small but to be expected in Europe","The hotel is exceptional. The staff was amazing, went above and beyond to satisfy you.

Needed a lesson on use of beautiful equipment.,As we were celebrating our wedding anniversary, our room was upgraded - A nice touch !!
We found the area /roads/shops very noisy as expected for a city - however walking through the doors of the Victoria Palace you felt a calming effect and tranquility about the whole hotel.
A very appetizing buffet was part of the room rate and complements must be passed to the chef for the best scrambled eggs that I have eaten at a hotel breakfast. Hope to stay again one day.,This boutique hotel was very charming. The staff was incredibly friendly, the rooms clean, up to date, and the beds were very comfortable. Unfortunately the weather didn‚Äôt permit us to utilize their outside breakfast stress which was unfortunate, because it was darling.,Location was excellent. Ease of access. The lunge area.

From the moment we walked in the door until the staff helped us place our bags in the taxi as we departed, we could not have wished for a better experience! Aurelian greeted us on arrival and offered help and suggestions throughout our stay. This was our first visit to Paris, and Gwen patiently answered our questions, always with a smile. The 2024 Paralympics altered access to some areas, but Areski was invaluable in his assistance in plotting an alternate route so we could enjoy a dinner cruise on the Seine. 

The beds were extremely comfortable and the breakfast was wonderful with many delicious choices. The location is in the 6th arrondissement, convenient to Luxembourg Garden, the Latin Quarter, restaurants, and transportation. I highly recommend this exceptional hotel for anyone considering a stay in Paris.,Everything 
Location ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è,Everything was perfect! Nice and comfortable atmosphere! Very nice and helpful staff!,The room was clean and comfortable and I liked the little balcony that enabled me to watch the street scene. The beds were very comfortable, the room temperature was andjuatable, and there was no street or hallway noise at all while we slept.

The air conditioning was also very good and you were able to regulate it. The staff was wonderful!!! Thank you to Marie Claire who was always willing to help me find my way around Paris 

I was able to open the window and look down at a nice cafe across the street. There are plenty of places, walking distance including a small grocery store. 

The elevator was wonderful to have.,Everything was perfect! I took a few months to find the perfect location and hotel in Paris. This was a very special trip for us and we wanted it to be just right.

My room had a view of Eiffel Tower. I fell in love. Such a surprise for the amount I paid. I was shocked and surprised.,Plentiful and delicious breakfast. Proximity to the Metro was perfect.,This hotel upon arrival is just as pictured. My daughter‚Äôs jaw dropped we entered. She couldn‚Äôt believe we were staying here. 

We were warmly greeted in English. The lady that helped us and explained everything throughly. She left no stone unturned. She explained how breakfast worked, how they could help with transportation, and secure tickets to various entertainment venues (like museums). Her warmth was like a welcoming hug from family. 

I opted for the slightly bigger room as suggested. I‚Äôm glad I did. Although it was cozy, I can‚Äôt imagine smaller. The decor and details were definitely luxe. 

I did find the room to be on the warmer side. We had to open the window to further cool the room. The window was huge and ample. There was one chair and one cushion/stool for seating. 

The hotel was situated near a subway train station, a very short walk, there were many shops, restaurant options, and small markets within walking distance.,Location, comfort, helpful staff,Wonderful breakfast

"5, Rue Riboutt√©, 9th arr., 75009 Paris, France",H√¥tel Veryste & Spa Paris,"Nothing to not like.,I stayed in room 301 and it wasn't sound proof! My sleep got disturbed by guests next door coming from partying at 4 am in the morning and they got pretty loud in their adult""party""!,The buffet breakfast options were too limited. But it was a small space.,Nothing,The only thing was the shower door didn‚Äôt close properly and no tv channels in English.,Somehow, if you are coming back at night you can not enter the hotel without a staff member. Sometimes you have to wait a bit until they show up and open the entrance door for you.,From the air conditioning a very bad smell came out, we had to switch it off to avoid the smell. Sometimes it was noisy because of the metro. The water pressure in the shower was quite low and some parts of the shower were coming down so that would really need some maintenance.,N/A,The walls are thin so you can hear the people in the next room and above you.,We had an episode in which after we checked out they charged me for a beer (?) After some talking back and forth they apologized and refund me. However, it almost ruined the good impression we had of the place.
It's not very centric but we walked a lot and it turned out just fine.,It sells itself as being kind of luxurious but in reality the rooms are still very small and offer standard amenities. Nonetheless we had a great stay! People were nice, helpful, friendly. The rooms were super clean and renovated. I would stay again, but not for close to 300‚Ç¨ per night.,Extra 200 EUR deposit.,The noise of the underground until1 and back in the morning just horrible,It is not so comfortable because of small areas, but it matches the expectation.,My shower tray had a problem of draining, the breakfast place at the ground-floor is a bit too small and can get crowded in the morning.,Didn‚Äôt realise how small the room was,Check in quite late - 3pm,Nothing,The hotel has just one elevator.,Clean and good size rooms,Sorry, no complaints!,the lobby could do with a glam up and have the same level as the room which was very nice.,The lift wasn't working but the workers at the hotel helped with the language.,very cold AC centrally controlled 
cold in the lobby/breakfast area with the main entrance opening the doors widely every time someone enters/leaves,Room is tiny :),everything went extremely well. no complaints whatsoever,we had no complaints. excellent all around.,you could hear some noise from the levels above and outside the door so it‚Äôs not fully soundproof but that didn‚Äôt take away from a great stay.,nothing,We could hear the metro each time it passed the hotel, but it didn't interrupt our sleep or relaxation time, just something we had to get used to.,Some street noise, but that is normal for Paris.,The hotel took out ‚Ç¨200 deposit from my bank account which was returned several days after departing.,The mattress is a bit stiff which might be an issue for some people.,Nothing really. I heard some noise coming from the room upstairs, but this is Paris so in general you expect to hear other people. It wasn't so bad and I slept perfectly fine.,Room was a bit smaller than expected, but this was the cheapest room!,Mainly cleanliness of room. Long hairs in bed.,Even though our room was in the top floor, you can hear some AC unit noises throughout the night. Not a deal breaker though.,Room is small, but thats Paris,Furniture in breakfast area bit small for someone 190cm.,The location , quietness and the cleanness,it very small, this drastically lacks generosity. I would hope a place for rest, welcoming. The service is minimalistic, looks a hospital room. 
It was ok, but we slept and leave quickly.,Breakfast,The rooms are a bit small,I was a big shocked to be asked for a ‚Ç¨200 deposit for a one-night stay, but it was refunded automatically.,Internet connection was not good,Room was a little small, but okay for a few nights with just two of us.,The toilet was faulty and we could hear what I believe was the metro close by at night time,If they had provide more hair soap and conditioner per day.,Internet quality and distance,Walls are thin, you can hear neighbors upstairs and you can hear people walking on the stairs.,Nothing,The room was really really small, not sure it matches the 4* requirements tbh, the bathroom is even smaller hardly any room to stand in front of the sink. There's a weird cheap air freshener smell throughout the hotel. You can also feel ( rather than hear ) the vibration of the tube tracks every time a train passes by. Not a major inconvenience for us but worth knowing if you're not a good sleeper it might bother you.,The cleaning could be better but it wasn‚Äôt bad.,Bathroom is slightly small, but functional.,nothing,4 stars is a bit generous for this hotel: towels were worn and hard, room was noisy (neighbours and metro can be easily heard) and most staff members at the reception were not very welcoming or communicative,Sound proof is really poor with the room above. I could hear everything including Lourd conversations.,The room wasn't very fresh, there was sewage odor coming from bathroom through the night, and especially strong in the morning. 
The breakfast area is very small, not many seating places, and had to wait for a table to be freed. Breakfast was with small selection of cold appetizers, and definitely could be better.
As a frequent visitor to Paris, i found the hotel price to be somewhat higher than expected and think that hotel offer wasn't a great value for that price.,Slightly noisy due to metro. Little details, more hangers, slippers and a robe etc would take to 10/10,not noisy and very good location.,Perhaps apply to most, but roughly double the rate because the champions league final. certainly making hay!","Absolutely beautiful rooms, and lobby.,The staff were friendly and really nice to talk to. Moreso, i enjoyed the location in a cosy neighbourhood and walking distance to most attractions i had planned.,I like how cozy it was and that it was cleaned everyday and close to a metro.,Perfect location, helpful staff, quiet and comfortable room (but not giant size ;),Friendly and helpful staff.

"144 Rue De La Tombe Issoire, 14th arr., 75014 Paris, France",Villa Royale Montsouris,"Sometimes the shower changes the water temperature so beware of cold one ;),It was a lack of toilet paper in the bathroom,Little bit not good air condition,Room was small. Very little room to move about at the bottom of the bed. Had to move sideways. Too many big pieces of furniture in the room. Not a major issue but was a bit annoying.,A little bit noisy from the traffic if you come during a week. We were there on a weekend and it was OK.,Small rooms,Nothing,Uncomfortable bed, water pressure low in the morning, unfriendly receptionist,I don't have anything to complain about.,As other reviews have stated, the breakfast offering is limited but it you are prepared for that then this is a good place to stay.,Location too far away for the action,It is not a case that we didn't like anything. The breakfast facilities were quite small and therefore very busy at times. As the facilities were quite compact, the staff had some issues keeping the levels of stock, and there was a great variety, and it was spotlessly presented and very clean and in a pleasant atmosphere.,The bed lights didn‚Äôt have a switch. You had to disconnect them from the plug.,The only thing I would mention is that the bath is a little slippy when showering, so maybe a bath mat would help. Otherwise, everything was great üëç,size of the room,Everything was fine for a one night stay,Nothing major,riom was a.little.cramped,Not enough space, shower configuration is uncomfortable. I had allergic reaction to air conditioning (this is personal, however),We had 2 rooms points to mark
Toilet door has a peephole and locks from outside This is quite non privacy
Bathtub shower needs closure else the commode and floor gets wet 
Coffee maker was available in smaller room but missing in bigger room,Breakfast was OK but nothing hot. Coffee machine was cleaned during breakfast time. We waited long for it to be giving coffee,No negatives,The room was a bit small for the size of the bed, so not a lot of space for moving around. (OK for one person, not good for two.) Bathroom door closing mechanism rustic but easy to catch oneself on, given the small space. First 2 nights were quiet, 3rd less (other guests).,room is a little bit small.,Room was very small. The light wear the bed was not working.,n/a,Sloping ceiling in my bedroom, where I had to bend down getting out of bed as I'm tall .,The rooms are very small, the breakfast room was very small and the breakfast, while good, was not very diverse.,The one thing I did not like and someday they can try fit it into their business is having outlets for foreigners to charge their devices. Not everyone has the same charging system or electric system. The design of the closet was not very appealing to me.,The room is a little small but I think it's the standard across Paris.,Pillows could have been better and the position of the shower head was terrible. It made showering quite difficult.,However the shower was odd and the shower head was facing the the entrance of the shower which had no curtain or door, this being said a lot of water spilled out into the bathroom everywhere. The wifi was also very poor we had trouble downloading movies for our later flight on our phone.,Hot water wasn't steady. Lift didn't work and the staircases are rather slippery.,The views,The original room was tiny. Without an upgrade charge, we were given a bigger room. It's removed from any tourist location, so you must figure out a way to get around Paris.,Small room, no bedside light. No tea/ coffee making facilities,The shower is outdated and uncomfortable, the dining room is small, the location is very far from the city,A bit warm,Nothing,None,It would be better if there is a curtain or something to block the bath place from the toilet. But it is still clean and acceptable.,Cons: It‚Äôs an older hotel that hasn‚Äôt been very upgraded - but the biggest problem was the safe in the room was locked and when I went several times to ask to have it opened, nothing was ever done. Upon arriving home I noticed my favourite pair of earrings was missing - hopefully not stolen? - and when I emailed the hotel as to whether they had been found I received no response at all. Very disappointing - the safe if it could have been used would have kept them ‚Äúsafe‚Äù!,I liked everything, but is would be nice if in the bathroom could be a carpet.,The accommodation was nice and comfortable and the staff were very friendly,make breakfast bigger,A small selection of food :/,everything espicially the breakfast,No complaints, really. If I was arm-twisted hard, I'd say the toilet paper could be better (it just didn't go with the rest of my lovely experience üòâ).,Rooms were uncomfortable, like a grandmother tight house, we chose a double bed , we got 2 beds connected , very uncomfortable, the room was cold, the hairdryer was not functioning,We had a very unpleasant experience for a 4 nights stay mainly due to the staff‚Äôs lack of interest. We arrived and saw an announcement that they are unable to provide hot water for the night, unfortunately we had no hot water for THE ENTIRE STAY and when we asked the receptionists about it they all lied and told us that they will fix the issue ‚Äútomorrow‚Äù, which obviously never happened. When confronted, one of them admitted that they are lying and that we should take a cold shower instead. We were met with an impossible rudeness and a disdainful attitude and no interest in the customer experience. 
No real solutions were provided, they just did not care enough to call for someone to get it fixed. 
I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this for anyone who wants to enjoy their vacation.
Bonus picture with ""the view"" :),Rooms are small but probably a normal Paris-size. The main problem was that during our WHOLE stay the boiler was broken so there was no hot water. In a rainy, colt start of October it was not a pleasant situation. Only after complaining about the situation, the reception staff invited us to have free breakfast as an apology. I nice gesture but not enough for the discomfort and also it came only after we complained. I also felt that the lack of interest in solving the problem came from the fact that there were not many people at the hotel at that time, which basically meant our satisfaction didn‚Äôt really mean much to the management. It is a pitty because the hotel has potential, the staff was nice, but the experience afterall was bad.,The staff is not really friendly and seems annoyed if you talk to them. The breakfast staff seems bored and is not very polite with the guests. That is the same for the woman at the reception. We have been to many hotels around the world and everywhere the staff was better. Considering that the price is not that low, we were a little bit disappointed. 
The bathroom is beautiful but the shower didn't have pressure and fluctuated from hot to cold water. 
The hotel is badly soundproofed.,Wifi was very slow. 
Rooms are small. 
Breakfast didn't have enough choices. Pastries tasted old.
We didn't even bother having breakfast on our check out day as they didn't have Pastries left the day before. 
I asked for the room to be cleaned and it wasn't cleaned. 
Curtains are damaged. 
Garbage collection so noisy.,Hotel seems a bit old and badly maintained. The room stank something like moist, I could hear everything my neighbour was saying, the towels were very small, the lamp was not working, the complementary bottle of water was half empty, no glasses, bed poorly made, I had no idea breakfast was available, the staff barely told me a word and I‚Äôm French.,Air con is not satisfactory in all rooms. Very strong in some, mediocre in others and non existent in others also. 

My oom was not serviced one of the days, could due to a room change due to an aircon issue.,There are bed bugs","We were looking for a peaceful, small, and nice-looking hotel within acceptable distance to the center of Paris and Villa Royale was a perfect choice for us.

The plumbing was a little antiquated, and as a surveyor, I could go into tremendous detail. However, it was functional.

"24 Rue Ramey, 18th arr., 75018 Paris, France",H√¥tel Juliette,"Breakfast was overpriced. Not worth ‚Ç¨40 for 4 of us.,Tiny bathroom. Breakfast only continental,Small rooms,very close to Montmarte,The room was quite warm but the windows helped a little.,It doesnt have AC in rooms, so in summer it could get a bit hot,There could‚Äôve been more space to put your stuff. Like one or two cabinets. Also it was very loud when people on other rooms took a shower or ran the sink. But other than that, everything was fine.,Kettle in the bedroom to make tea!,I'm not sure why they set up 3 beds in my room although I asked for 2 beds only.,The fire doors and doors of adjoining rooms were solid and made quite a noise when shutting.

I'm just not used to noise.,Accessibility,Rue Ramey is very noisy but that's not the hotel's fault. The back rooms are much quieter.,didn't like the location that much. it was close to montmartre and sacre coeur but far from other places, also the metro area didn't feel safe. also there is no elevator so if you're having trouble climbing 6 floors it's not the place for you. i looked for nice cafes in the areas but the good ones open late or too far.,Poor ventilation and noisy street. We could hear everything from the rooms next to and above us. Although convenient location, felt unsafe in the streets closer to the metro where there were massive crowds of people.,TV remote not working. Low battery.

But hey, the exercise is good when your eating lots of French cheese! View from rooms is to grotty ‚Äúcourt yard‚Äù - but we weren‚Äôt in the room other than to sleep!,No lift so have to carry your bags up stairs. Can be noisy when other guests are coming and going.,The only thing that was tough was the fact that there was no lift (just for the purpose of carrying the bags up and down as I didnt mind going up and down without the bags.,no elevator to 6th floor,The window didn't close very well, so we could hear the street noise (which could get quite loud with people partying close by). There was 4 flights of stairs to get to our room, so we would recommend requesting a lower level if you are less abled,Ensuite had no toilet, it was on the landing and so shared.,The only downside of the property was that there wasn‚Äôt an elevator, and the stairs were a little bit even.

Also, you are only given one towel per person.,No elevator,The hotel is so close to great places to see, restaurants, bars, and cafes. It's tempting to stay out all night!,The host was not happy with my late arrival, so make sure you agree on your check-in hours in advance. There is no elevator in the hotel, so you'll have to carry your luggage upstairs by yourself. The room lacks some essential facilities, like an iron board, but you can find some of them at the reception desk. The wi-fi connection was not always stable.,Too much stairs, without a lift,The location is not great, quite pricey considering the location.,The breakfast was a bit sober and not my cup of tea.,Weather was very hot during my stay, which I managed with my small fan i packed and having my window open but allowed more street noise making it more difficult to sleep. I was prepared for no lift, so stairs good exercise!,No bath in the rooms, no elevator.","They are so friendly. There is a warm and cozy ambiance and a sweet cat üò∫.

No problems,Noise from street early in the morning (4am) on garbage collection mornings.,Pillows too soft,I didn't care for the surly waiter from the restaurant.,The pillows were so thin and didn‚Äôt provide any support so your head would end up on the mattress, it was like not having a pillow at all, gave me really bad neck pain.

Good I suppose that it made you shower faster.,The website mentions laundry services but they don‚Äôt provide any such services.,The walls were very thin - I could hear the people next to me when their phones vibrated. Additionally, I was woken up in the middle of the night by a particularly loud couple who were repeatedly banging their headboard into the wall. Also - the shower is a washroom, not a traditional american shower. I think this would be good to note to people.,Nothing,It is a bit small but it served our purpose.,The night the water ran out but the fixed during the next couple of hours,Due to location (and possibly location of our room) we could hear a lot of noise from the ally restaurants below late into the night. 
Also, other guests in the hotel don't seem to be considerate of others, they would come in LATE at night and talk very loud in hallways, slam doors etc. I only mention, because it seemed to be consistent (at least 5 out of 6 nights we stayed) and not necessarily the same people. Not sure if this is a European habit or what, but at least one of them seemed to be an American family w/children (based on language and accent).,The walls were so thin I could hear the woman in the next room screaming into her telephone until 1 in the morning! 
The restaurant was mostly pizza and pasta. The menu never changed! I wanted breakfast included but that wasn‚Äôt an option without also paying for dinner too. When I called the hotel and asked about the food they never told me that I was paying 50‚Ç¨/day for (an admittedly excellent breakfast) pizza, pasta or a poke bowl.

A lot of performers, musicians, dancers et al, stopped at the end of the street to do their thing. 
The shower was very good and my room also had a large soaking tub.

"5 rue du 8 Mai 1945, 10th arr., 75010 Paris, France",NH Paris Gare de l'Est,"I didn't like how it reminded me of the kind of terrible hotel room you can get in the US for more than twice the price, like at most chain hotels or a mom and pop motel. Our room was a little small by US standards, but we didn't mind at all.,N/a,The hotel doesn‚Äôt have a gym.,Small room.,The toilet seat was loose and the room decor felt a little tired with chipped doors etc.,It is a nice place..Very clean..,.,My room, 602, was smaller than i have had in the past.,quite small room,I wish there was a restaurant on site or the ability to order a sandwich or something.,One thing I notice not actually I don‚Äôt but the toilet bowl it‚Äôs high, sorry for that,Some noise from trains. a bath with shower rather than a walk- in shower,Nothing of importance,The only gripe is that the air con always blew cold air even when the thermostat was set to 25¬∞C or even 30 ! With an infant, we wanted the room to be warmer and could not achieve that.,Very small room considering the high price. OK for one night.
I was surprised to be asked to pay extra for my wife's breakfast, even though I gave two names for the room.,Nothing,Everything is good. But they told us that the 1st day we have two free bottled water that never happened we dont have bottled water in our rooms.,N/A,I didn‚Äôt experience any serious problems during my stay, although I think the drainage for the bathroom sink and air conditioning might have needed a bit of maintenance. They still functioned correctly, so this may just be a part of running a large hotel in an old building.,Service in some area,The purple! üòú,Nothing I can think of,Inability to open the doors / issue with WiFi - but this is really kind of Force Majeure after the IT issues during that week

Would be nice to have a possibility of less pricy option for breakfast for the children,I cannot say dislike, but it was a little bit too much of a room fragrance in the foyer,The areas isn‚Äôt great to walk around especially in the evening but the metro is right outside so that was fine,I thought the price of the room included the tourist tax but I ended having to pay additional. The location was close to a train station but if you‚Äôre heading out, it‚Äôs not the main train station.,We felt a little unsafe walking around the local area in the evenings. Best to stick to metro travel or Ubers at night rather than walking.,nothing,No complaints.,The bed size for 2 is too small,The AirCon in my room not running well, a little bit Hot, I‚Äôd complaint but no respond, the day after still same ‚ÄúHOT‚Äù,The staff are rude as they dont understand English properly . The check in process was painful taking 1 hour for 11 people to check in. The hotel needs to give training to their staff on good customer service experience with a smile and being friendly . This was the only thing letting down such a lovely hotel,The breakfast was quite expensive. It may be because we paid separately. The breakfast area also felt a little cramped but the food and service was lovely. However, with handy restaurants just outside, you could easily grab something there instead.,Nothing,The hobos sleeping next to the entrance and urinating in front of every body,Our room is on the 4th floor but since it faces a busy street, it‚Äôs very noisy. If you are a light sleeper, you would not be able to have a good sleep.,Quite a lot of traffic noise.,Wifi was not working for a couple of days.,Internet connection is bad - 2 out of the 3 nights our devices connected to the wifi but without any internet connection.,All good,No wifi on arrival in room on that day.,Nothing,Nothing.,The cleaners was too noisy at early morning chatting loudly and hitting the walls by their equipment, also check-in was a bit slow.,Nothing,Noise,The shower was clean but had a bit of a hard time draining which was slightly inconvenient.,The morning breakfast was always short of cutlery and eating space. Their plates are too small and many people ended up serving in multiple plates, leaving many guests serving themselves in paper napkins. But despite all these challenges, their staff were very polite and going extra mile to serve the guests at breakfast. 
The hotel should consider having adequate sized cutlery in adequate numbers. Also in holiday and peak season, they should have extended breakfast hours.,The scaffolding outside but realise the work had to take place.,the room size is a bit small, the washroom could have a better drainage system as the water that spills out of bathtub, enters directly into the room.,Quite small room and not very soundproof - can hear people walking past your room late at night.,Housekeeping attended our room even though we left a Do not disturb sign at the door,The shampoo, conditioner and soap at the bathroom is hardly possible to collect from the push pump. I understand the hotel is trying to save but that's too little.,The carpet was clean but feels a bit dirty to be walking barefoot so I wished they provided slippers. And the room was a bit snug for 2 adults. But unless you're planning to stay in the hotel during the day. It's not an issue at all.","This place is fantastic in every respect. The location is ideal with metro access within feet of the entrance. It's in the heart of the 10e arrondissement which is not at all overwhelmed with tourists, but is an up and coming residential area with lots of shops, several vintage clothing stores, etc. The Gare de l'est is across the street, which a pretty interesting old train station with links to areas outside ile de france region. There is an excellent old-fashion restaurant just next door that is wonderful and inexpensive. The value for the price is almost unbelievable. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to friends.,Unexpectedly had a gorgeous balcony room with views of the Eiffel Tower. My mum had informed them that it was my birthday and we were given muffins, balloons and a note. It was a lovely touch. The hotel felt safe, the staff were friendly and the room was very clean.

Breakfast was very good indeed, with a good choice for everyone.,Breakfast was awesome...The personel was nice and available..I really enjoyed having breakfast there..,The team was friendly and accommodating overall, but on one of the nights, I lost a backpack. The next day, I asked the gentleman at the reception if they could check the cameras to see if I returned with the backpack. The response I received was that they would need the police and a formal justification to review the footage. I didn't ask to view the footage myself‚Äîjust to confirm whether I had returned with the backpack. I felt a bit disappointed that they didn't try to help more and instead gave what seemed like an unnecessary excuse. However, the location is excellent, the check-in team was friendly, and the room was adequate.,I love this hotel, and have stayed here 4 times now. Great breakfast buffet. Comfortable rooms. Great view of Sacre C cathedral to wake up to each morning! Ideal location for train connections, and restaurants. Will stay here again and again. Wish it could still be booked via British Airways holidays. However, because of enjoyable stays at the hotel before, it was worth booking it separately to my flights.,The breakfast was good. Lots of choice and fresh. The metro is just outside as are some very good restaurants.,Nice staff and good location opposite The station (gare l‚Äôest),Lovely comfortable room and breakfast.

Much appreciated!,Location, next door to metro.
Easy access to local amenities.,Top location, nice staff, quiet rooms and modern rooms. Great value for money.,The cleanliness and staff are both top-notch. The buffet breakfast was also very good. The location is equally fantastic with the Metro or Buses and even walking distance to most of what you'd want to visit,I like NH properties. This hotel location was great since we were leaving from Gare dl‚Äôest. However it was a bit loud on the street. Otherwise nice.,The hotel is in a highly convenient location, looking out over Paris Gare de l'Est station.

The reception area was clean and smart and had seating and drinks. The family suite room was spacious and clean with a lovely view of historic Gare de l'Est and the surrounding area. The location is great for travelling around Paris near both metro and mainline trains, and there are shops and restaurants alongside the hotel for convenience, plus a park nearby (although we didn't have time to check this out).

"17 bis rue Am√©lie, 7th arr., 75007 Paris, France",Le 7 Eiffel Hotel by Malone,"It was quite dated in parts, but that didn‚Äôt affect our stay! The room was very small, but since we didn‚Äôt spend much time in the room, this was ok!,Nothing,The lift wasn‚Äôt working and we were on top floor.,The carpet was in terrible condition definitely needs replaces the room was really nice except for that.,Lift out of order,Reception,No view in spite of advertisement,Small room. No way to communicate with staff except by calling from your phone,Great little hotel in the centre of paris,Nothing,They don‚Äôt really tell you much of anything, we had to explore the hotel to find things for ourselves. Felt a little like a burden,Washroom was missing exhaust and no door for washroom, only curtain.,Nothing at all,Well when i arrived at Aug/14th around 11am, the gentleman was looking at me like i don‚Äôt belong here and he even didn‚Äôt say a hi! But the lady was nice, also the gentleman who get the taxi on last night, Aug/18th around 5am, he was very nice

Also, when i was taking the shower, the room was full of water since the bathroom door is not working properly,It is obviously a little pricey, but comparable to other properties that don't appear to be as good as this one! Don't let the journey from the airport put you off - it was easy enough with a bus and a quick metro.,Breakfast was a little disappointing, with little choice for the price they charge.,Could of had more items for breakfast,Room was a little on the small side,The breakfast could be better and the guy in charge was a bit rude,Okay,Carpet could use an update.,Not much at all.,Rooms and especially the toilet is tiny. I‚Äôm 180 cm and 77 kgs but I hardly fit.,Refill on things in room. 
Conditioner and water,No shampoo or body wash in our room,There was no functioning ventilation in the bathroom, so it got quite steamy. One of our rooms had a bit of an odd odor, but it had been improved by cleaning products and did not bother the family members who stayed there. It would be nice to label the hot snacks, as we were surprised to find ham in the tiny pizzas. It would be nice to have more bar drinks on offer in the very nice bar area. Overall, we were quite happy with the hotel.,Average hotel, more like a three star. Breakfast is very basic and flies all around the open fruit. Small bedroom. The top terrace has only a view of buildings, no view of the city or the Eiffel tower. I would not stay in it again, it is more suited to anyone looking for a one night stay - small bedroom, no atmosphere, food not nice.,Rooms could have been a bit larger, but that is difficult to do so close to the Eiffel Tower, especially for the price.,We could hear the noises and the discussions from other rooms pretty clear‚Ä¶ also the door of the room had to be really pulled to be really closed (and it was not only from our room like that),Price,The rooms are very small (we had two rooms for four people and it could feel crowded) but at the low price of rooms and phenomenal hotel location, it was worth it for us. If you plan to be in your room a lot it may be too small for comfort, but we were only in our room to sleep and it was perfect.,Price.,I would say isolation is not perfect, but who cares after 15km walk in Paris
I would say breakfast is not perfect, but who cares given the choice around 
Very decent place to stay in the heart of Paris (I am comparing with 5 stars twice expensive),The room decor was awful. The red felt on the walls is horrible, and the trompe l'≈ìil carpet in the halls is hideous and disorientating after a couple of glasses of champagne!,rooms were small but efficient. breakfast is expensive esp given bakeries near by the hotel.,carpets need upgrading,Toilet not in bathroom.,we couldn‚Äôt change the language to English on the tv and also a lot of noise in the morning which woke us up,Breakfast was very limited and there was only a small amount available. The room would have been better with a shower that wasn't over the bath and a better view. We paid a premium as we booked at the last minute due to not being able to stay at the hotel we'd originally booked in at. If we were to have paid in advance, it would have been about half of the price.,The breakfast didn‚Äôt offer much and there were tons of fruit flies in the snack and juice area.,The rooms weren‚Äôt soundproof as mentioned. I could hear the room next door coughing and talking very clearly,The rooms and bathrooms are small. I know that is common for Europe and it was not a problem for us but ‚Äúbigger‚Äù persons may be inconvenienced.,None,Pricey. I probably wouldn‚Äôt recommend staying in this area, it really only has the Eiffel Tower.,N/A,2 small sachets of coffee in the room, between two of us was a bit disappointing.","It was nice to have breakfast & coffee right in the hotel before leaving for the day of sightseeing.

Comfortable bed,The location was walking distance (12-15 mins) to the Eiffel Tower, and our room was open and airy and clean. Plenty of room for my wife and I. There is also a pastry shop, restaurants, and shopping all within blocks of the hotel. We took a taxi to/from the Eurostar station - while it only a few miles from the station, allow for plenty of time - it takes about 40-45 minutes with congested traffic. My wife and walked everywhere once there (21 miles in two days to see the Louvre, Arche de Triomphe, Eiffel Tower day and night, Notre Dame, and souvenir shopping), but you can always take a taxi if walking is not your thing.,Excellent location, comfortable bed and good bathroom.

On a street with many very good cafes and just a block from some historic restaurants like Le Dome. Other nearby spots offer excellent food at reasonable (Paris) prices.

"15 rue Edouard Manet, 13th arr., 75013 Paris, France",COQ Hotel Paris,"nothing.,All was great .no complaints. 
 Mehdi was an incredible host at front desk. Was very helpful and superb service.,If I had to choose one issue, it would be the thickness of the walls. They were not as soundproof as we had expected, and we could clearly hear the morning cleaning activities and doors closing. However, this shouldn't be a problem if you tend to wake up early, before the usual morning cleaning schedule begins.,Wish that there had been a shower as well as a bath and that there was a big light to illuminate the room as well as the lovely lamps.,Nothing,Room was little bit small and there was no refrigerator.,I would have killed for conditioner in the shower and a complimentary comb but only because I forgot to bring mine.,The rooms were very small and the walls kind of thin,Nothing; everything was honestly perfect,The only thing I didn't like was that the bathroom door was hard to close. Everything else was wonderful.,Breakfast was good but a tad crowded,The rooms do not have a refrigerator, there is only one at the reception. It is a common problem in Paris, many hotels do not have refrigerators in the rooms.,N/A,Not much,The breakfast was not included because it looked just fantastic and super delicious, but therefore the rate was lower,Shower was great but overall the bathroom was quite cramped, only space for one person at a time. The toilet was in a separate, tiny cubicle.

No other negatives of note.,Nothing was wrong at all!,Nothing,Maybe it‚Äôs the season but I feel inside the room was quite humid. And the bath tub design is very stylish but not as practical for people who only want some shower.,The only fault I have is it would be nice to have the option of hot drinks like teas in your room, not just coffee,Room was a little tight but livable.,housekeeping could have done a bit better. the refillable hand soap and lotion were on the very tiny bathroom counter rather than in their holders, plus tissues on the counter, basically meant there was no space for us to actually use. the sheets should have been changed and weren't, only the bed was made up. Used coffee capsules not replaced.,Nothing,No fridge in room and some lack of space to put your clothes and stuff.,The street was quiet, so no outside noise and was no room-to-room noise but the banging of the doors and people talking loudly in the corridors at night. I think this is most hotels though and wasn‚Äôt a huge problem.,Pillows can be better. Fridge in the room.,N/A,The room could have done with being a bit bigger,Nil,There should be more places to hang towels. Other than that we have nothing,Most people will note it is not in a ‚Äúhappening‚Äù part of Paris, but it is next to all the main line trains and the cost savings is well worth it during busy times.,Nothing. I liked everything.,The only downside was that showering in the bathtub was a bit awkward due to its design.,None,Good breakfast, but some waiting for re-filling the service tables in both mornings.,The thin doors allow noise from the corridor to be heard, such as the vacuum cleaner in the morning. However, overall, there was no noise from the street, which was good. 
It would be helpful for front office employees to have more knowledge about Paris attractions, as they were not able to offer much assistance.,The soap has an str√¢nge and difficult way to function. Although The missing of an shoehorn. 
But these are small things that cannot change the excelent impression. And a piece of advise for owners: maybe a more varied breakfast.","Clean. Staff was amazing.

But that is part of the character of the place!,Walls in the room need to be refurbished.,Wi-Fi didn't work which is a big problem for me. My daughter was disappointed for not having Wi-Fi or TV. As there was no A/C, we slept with open windows, and there was noisy because of emergency vehicles passing by all the time with siren on.,Only given one pillow each which isn‚Äôt enough and we had a black out from around 2am - 7/8am in the entire hotel. Other than that minor inconvenience, we had a lovely stay here at this hotel.,The stairs were a bit steep, we didn‚Äôt mind but may be an issue for someone with reduced mobility.,none,N/A,Shower over bath and a little difficult to access.

The stairs are steep, exceptionally narrow, and it‚Äôs a complete walk-up that‚Äôs noisy. You aren‚Äôt sparing your neighbors, and your legs after a long day out will complain. The room I stayed in was very small, tired, and the bed was an old beaten up twin mattress. Not comfortable.,the bathroom door knob was broken,Location,Some renovation and repair are needed.,nothing that can be fixed. The building has small hallways, thin walls and narrow rooms. It is also the charm of the city and also this hotel.,Small touches like the curtains in the room that I was in could have been improved,The cleaning service should improve, especially the bathtub was really dirty.,Just a bit tight for space.,We are old and climbing the steps was difficult. We were aware that there would be no elevator before we booked it but booked it anyway because of the location and it was a last minute reservation. Only a partial shower barrier and water splashed in the floor. My roommate slipped on the wet bathroom floor and hit her head and back on the tub. She is still in pain a week later.,The rooms were careworn and a bit shabby but it didn't affect the comfort of our stay and could be expected at the price. Some noise from outside, as this is a location in the centre of Paris. Some people might be concerned that there is no lift as the accommodation is spread over three floors,The shower was somewhat compact and the shower tray felt quite slippery.,No elevator (knew that in advance),The only thing we did miss was a kettle so we could have a morning tea or coffee, but there are plenty of local cafes.
As there isn't a lift it's only suitable for the more agile as it's in an old 17th century building with narrow stairs.,The secretary desk in my room had a broken handle and wouldn‚Äôt open. No view whatsoever (window went to a small interior cubby with gardening tools),took some time to get in our room. check in was delayed multiple times but the staff handled it very friendly so i don‚Äôt want to complain to much. bed isn‚Äôt the biggest but comfy regardless.,The carpets were a bit dirty and the bathroom smelt odd.

It was available on reception though.,Not really a complaint but being an old building no lift & steep narrow stairs (common enough in Europe). So lugging bags up & down can be a challenge. The room also has very old furnishings, but again not really a complaint. just putting it down for other people's reference.,Facilities limited - no kettle or fridge in rooms and stairs were quite narrow and winding so anyone with mobility issues might struggle,The hotel provides nothing in the way of food or drink but there didn't seem to be any facilities such as crockery, glasses or cutlery to be able to bring food or drink into the property although to be fair I didn't ask which I should have done.,All good,It could be a bit not comfortable to someone with luggage to go upstairs.

The bathroom looked like it had been recently updated and was very clean.,Bathrooms webs , no ac..,The hotel is very old and rooms are only big enough for a double bed - so just be aware if you prefer King or Queen beds, it‚Äôs a little hard to achieve here. It is charming but the carpet really needs replacing. When you‚Äôre paying a lot to stay in the centre of Paris with no elevator and a small bed, a television would be a good addition to the wall especially as we were there for the Olympics. We wish the owners well with their hotel improvements!,The hotel have everything thing you need but it is authentic Paris and have been used for many years.,Definitely no frills but the location is fantastic!,Wall paper in the hallways, stairs could be refinished and door to the toilet did not close.

"4 Cit√© Rougemont, 9th arr., 75009 Paris, France",Hotel De La Cite Rougemont,"Not totally a bad thing: distance from metro stop, but Bus stop are close and more comfortable transporting luggage.,Very small room for two people; no smart tv,There is not much not to like but I would say that only 2 inconvenients:
Small sink in the bathroom
A bit noisy due to the building being an old one with thin walls,The twin room was small and a bit dated, but size as expected for Paris and it‚Äôs a good price in a good location for sightseeing. No tea/coffee facilities in room - but I‚Äôve never found this in Paris- but could help yourself to the facilities on the rez-de-chauss√©e.,Shower wasn't the greatest haha but still a lovely stay.,The hairdryer is reallllly ancient,Bathroom very small.,The soundproofing isn't great, especially if there's people going to/from the lift, or people moving above you.,The prices were inflated due to the Olympics that it no longer offered value for money,The only downside is some mold in the bathroom.,N/a,bad internet((,Still noisy but it is the city.,It needed to be freshened up a bit,nothing,Slightly dated
Only 1 pillow per person,Nothing,It is what you pay for,There were no many amenities and the room was a little bit small.,Could be cleaner,power sockets are a bit loose,the only aspect that can be improved is breakfast, having more choice or a reasonable price, I would definitely have opted to comfortably have breakfast at the hotel.,Tiny bathroom without a radiator to hang the towels and dry them,Nothing.,The noise insulation is poor in the room which may surprise you if someone slept in other rooms besides it will make you awake at midnight if he had been snoring the whole night! The elevator is VERY small that it can basically contain two people and ONE case.,Fresh fruit at breakfast would be nice,The location is perfect. Even if the building is historical, I found it quite new and well maintained.,There was nothing to not like.,The room was small, but we were happy to get a single room for four people.,Elevator is small, but this is to be expected in an older building.,The price was in my opinion too high, it might be because there were many events happening like the world cup for rugby. 
Other than that the hotel was really good.,No A/C, charging extra for mini refrigerator .,There wasn‚Äôt a water boiler unfortunately.,Room is very small,It‚Äôs a bit of a walk from the town center so expect to walk 20 mins or so or take the metro. There isn‚Äôt air con but this wasn‚Äôt a problem at all. The fan provided was cooling enough.,It is basic room, no fridge and air conditioning ( which is clearly stated), but they provide fan.,Lack of air conditioning, although I realise this is standard in Paris. Would have been nice though.,small and a bit depressing room. expected a better room for this amount,No Ac,Nothing to complain,There were no slippers in room. One pillow had strange smell, it might be worth to change the bed linen conditioner. Also wifi connection was weak, fine to write some messages but nor for calls.,Lack of tea and coffee in the rooms,bit noisy,walls a bit thin at times but even thick walls can do nothing against noisy neighbours,Alot of noise early hours of the morning,breakfast was bit disappointing but nothing really,First night, we heard laud snoring from the next room so the walls may be thin. There was no tea/coffee making facilities in the room but this may be normal for a French hotel. The room can be hot at night but a fan is provided.,The room at little bit outdated, and was expecting a little bit more for the price.,everything was okay","Staff really friendly,

Small but everything was there.,The room we had was pretty clean. Albeit some mold stains in the bathroom, but I guess that's to be expected from an old hotel.

The staff is very friendly and helpful, always there for any need. The rooms are clean and comfortable, we had no problem resting although the walls are not thick/soundproofed.
The cold outside was not felt at all in the hotel, the facility is very well heated.
Some rooms have bathtub showers, others have showers. There is no bidet, as in most European countries. Unfortunately, breakfast is in line with French hotel standards, so a personal tip is to have breakfast outside if you have special needs. My rating is positive overall; the cost paid is average for Parisian accommodations, perhaps even cheaper than other options. I thank the hotel staff for their extreme kindness.,Location of awesome,It‚Äôs cool and serene,The room is relatively small in the corner of the building but it has full facilities we need for accommodation. Besides, the best thing is the room has a small balcony and it has a really nice view of the street. 
The location of the hotel is quite good which is close to the main metro stations and it's located inside of buildings with steel fences, safety max! 
The room is cleaned every day and everything is well organised except the duvet is weird that we cannot easily get used to.,Comfy bed, clean room , good shower, good tv, nice view surrounded by beautiful traditional buildings walking distance from loads of great shops and places to eat . Very short walk to metro station . Really central location but not loud at night at all , fun cheap bar just across the street,Perfect for the price.

"104 Boulevard de l'H√¥pital, 13th arr., 75013 Paris, France",HOTEL FORMIO,"I was happy with everything,But the Lady she was not courteous 
She was telling no it's 11, showed her face.

She was even pushing me to book cab through her even though I didn't wanted to,nothing,The room was very small, the elevator wasn‚Äôt working during my stay.,The wifi was terrible. Basically useless. The only negative.,There was no air conditioner. I appreciated the open window, however it was too hot to sleep at night.

Although it was not a problem, but maybe your site needs updating the pictures of the rooms as I was expecting a double room as it was advertised on booking.com,but it was a single bed.,Breakfast a bit limited for diabetic.,Wash rooms are small,A bit loud outside at night, but not the fault of the hotel.,Nothing, really. The staff made up for the room size. I assume the room was bigger in the picture than what I saw.,The room was a little small and no elevator,Quite noisy at night (some weird machine sound from the streets), no airconditioner,Near reception so a little noise until midnight,Well, because there is a problem with space in French hotels in general, the room was not very large and it didn‚Äôt have a small fridge.,There were no air-conditioning facilities and no Lift.,Especially in the morning the corridor can be a bit loud.,Rooms not massive but if it is just being used as a base to explore the city then perfect.,The elevator was not working,The was a charge of a city tax per day that was not included in quoted booking price, so had to pay that when checking in. There was a bit of confusion about breakfast charge. On first morning I had breakfast and also on the second morning, I thought it was optional, but somehow got charged for all 4 mornings. I had found some interesting places for breakfast instead but didn't realized I was being charged for times I didn't have it at the hotel. Also be aware there is no elevator but I was helped with bags up stairs.,The blanket on the bed was a bit too heavy for the weather and the room felt stuffy in the night. A fan or a lighter blanket would have made sleeping easier. The breakfast was held in a very small cramped area and it would have been better to go to a bakery or cafe instead. A coffee or tea only option for less money would have been fantastic.,Room was super small with Very small toilet
My room was on the 3rd floor no lifts
Told lift is for luggage only (sure luggage more valuable than people) even this wasn‚Äôt true as on me checking out I had to carry my 23kg suitcase all the way down as this silly lift wasn‚Äôt even working for the luggage,Bathroom is too small .,Some mornings it took quite a while for the water to heat up sufficiently for a shower and the shower head leaked quite a lot during use,Stairs can be a struggle with heavy luggage.,I didn't like no elevator facility to go up with the heavy suitcases. My spouse has developed arm shoulder joint ache. Reception is on the first floor. I wish if they can work on that. Most of the staffs were good and helpful except for on the weekdays lady at the reception.,The hairdryer is only available on request each time. To me that's important and I don't want to chase a hairdryer every morning.,Shower is tiny (I assume it‚Äôs a Paris/Europe thing but I‚Äôm not very tall and even I struggled to wash my hair in the shower,Room was small, without airco. The breakfast was very basic, mostly with sweet options.,Wasn't keen on having my passport photocopied - everything was paid in full, so was surprised. I think if details of guests need to be passed on because of city taxes etc. this could be done without photocopying passports.

Reception/breakfast area a bit odd and cramped. Lots of stairs, but lift non op. No air con and whilst good area to stay, noisy outside at night due close proximity to restaurant and bar. It's inner city, I know it'll probably be the same wherever!,It could be very hot in summers as the room is small (and can heat up very fast), and can't open the window as it is facing the main street.,Room tiny,Breakfast is very basic but ok. Also it would be great to have a flatter pillow.,The room was quite small, the reception and breakfast area very small and improvised,beware, some information is not communicated like: the elevator is ""still"" not in service with a reception at the first floor (second floor in US terms) and rooms are on the three floors above, so make sure you verify with the hotel before you book if you think you don't want to take your luggage 60 steps vertical. Finally.. they charged 50 Europe for a lost Room's key-card which is just ridiculous and exaggerated, in other hotels they give it as a souvenir for collectors.,Rooms was great for our one night.,Rooms doors are so loud when they are opened and closed, so I was woken up very early by other hotel guests leaving their rooms,- the window didn't close properly so it was super noisy + there was always a fresh breeze
- the room was right next to a big road, it was super noisy, no sleep without earplugs, also you could always hear toilets flushing
- the towel heater in the bathroom didn't work
- the apartment is the tiniest I have ever been,A coffee making facility (paid for) would be nice.,It was all good.,Nothing,Nothing,Nothing! Liked all,The lift unfortunately didn't work so I had to carry my heavy suitcase up to the floor.,Nothing! Everything was perfect & exceeded my expectations,All is super,It was way too small. It fit the bed and not much else. No A/C and the window didn‚Äôt have room to open all the way. No elevator. Had to carry luggage up 4 flights of stairs. No blow dryer, or iron. No room to put suitcases.,It‚Äôs pretty peripheral,No elevator, need to carry baggage by stairs which is terrible for a big and heavy baggage.
Staff can‚Äôt speak and understand English.,Room a bit smaller than expected,They took my phone charger while cleaning.,There was no hairdryer in the room, and it was quite small. While it was okay for a short stay, it could be an issue for a longer stay.,There's only one dryer for multiple room to share, which was extremely inconvenient as hair dryer is very essential and I didn't brought my own because it is included in the description. 

But I appreciated one of the staff reacted smartly on my last day, let me change the room where included hairdryer.

Then it shocked me again, as the room has the same price, the second room was actually bigger and with better facilitation. I'm wondering how fair it is regarding the room distribution.,The single room is very small and the website did not have any photos.
Also, bed did not have a normal regular bed pillow but instead there were two square sofa pillows instead!,Very tiny rooms. Room with single bed are not comfortable","It was a plenty room for one person, I arrived an hour later than indicated and there was no problem checking in as they are 24/7, they clean the room every day, you have a breakfast option, it is close to the subway and bus stations.,The male staff was quite good
He helped me to carry my big suitcase case as lift was not working

Good value,I chose this to be convenient for Gare de Lyon. To walk is one mile if that suits you. Or take metro or bus. Lots of fun inexpensive bars and eating places nearby. Room was spotless and excellent recently refurbished en suite.,The room was spotlessly clean and well-maintained. It was a single room, so not big, but perfectly adequate for a few days. The location is excellent for the metro and a short walk from interesting places such as the jardin des plantes. Quiet at night. The breakfast was a typical 'continental breakfast' and decent value for money.,The staff were just lovely, and the room was much nicer than I expected for the price. The beds were comfy, everything was clean and there were plenty of supplies.,The room was very clean and newly refurbished.
Polite staff and spoke English.

"2, Rue Berthollet, 5th arr., 75005 Paris, France",Serotel Lut√®ce,"Nothing,Bed,Rooms are small and could use a little more lighting. But most rooms in Paris are not large and the charm of the room made up fir its deficiencies.,.,No flipflops, towels etc...,The room was incredibly small; there being a gap of less than half a metre between the end of the bed and the wall. And because this was the wall that had the TV mounted on it, it made it doubly difficult to get to the wash/shower room. Sitting on the loo was also tricky. I‚Äôm about 1.85M tall so I had to drop down onto the toilet seat which is not good when one is 74.,But squeezy for a kind sized bed in the bedroom & managing luggage.,No thing.,All good except for car parking space ... rushed to unload our luggages... there is not an allocated space to park the car while unloading... no one to help,None,The price was inflated due to the Olympics. We normally would have expected a lot more for the amount we paid, but we understand this was during a special event. Our primary concern was that the hotel shower was very narrow, my husband had to stand sideways to use it.,Only the fire alarm, its not their fault. Someone smoke from the customer inside the room,We found the smell of vinegar (I assume they use to clean with ) of the carpet in between the connecting rooms far too strong .,Only a few good restaurant options within walking distance,Rooms were a little small,Little far from
The metro,None,The noise and dust of construction in much of Paris at this time was at times challenging. Though it also added an air of excitement in anticipation of the games, watching the seating setup along the Seine ... wondering how are they going to have this ready in time!,Shower head and bathroom faucets are bit dated in my room,Room was small which is typical for Paris (and have had smaller),Nothing everything went well.,Everything was great except the WiFi was a bit sketchy at times.,Nothing - The hotel is great as it is. Just keep doing the same.,-,Nothing.,We would prefer not to shower in a bath tub.,Vacuuming in room. Breakfast okay but uninspiring.,The breakfast was good but for all three mornings it was basically the same options. We were surprised to pay the city tax that was not mentioned on booking.com also (not including the city tax) the total price was more than what we were quoted for by booking.com,There was nothing we didn't like.,A bit of a walk to metro.
The price on booking for city taxes was a lot lower than we had to pay.,Small room,The stream from a shower somehow made the the fire alarm go off :( it was very embarrassing,Would like to have more breakfast options,Nothing to dislike,Nothing. It was perfect!,Maybe could have a bar.,Nothing,Street side room was noisy,Nothing really,Breakfast buffet good wasn‚Äôt value for the money only eat there one small rooms and bathroom but thats Paris,No bar area.,It is a little bit noisy, we could hear sounds from the rooms of the same floor,Nothing, everything was wonderful!","The location ,comfortable room, and balcony,Location was excellent,A lovely small hotel with very friendly staff.

The hotel is located close to the main attractions, 15 minutes walk from the metro and 20 minutes walk to Notre Dame Cathedral, The room was very clean and quiet at night, and the staff was friendly and helpful I was able to communicate in Spanish and Portuguese with some of the front desk staff. A few restaurants around and bakeries. The neighborhood is safe. I will definitely come back again. Well done Serotel Luteceüëç,Hotel was in a quiet area of the city yet with close proximity to many things/areas. We were able to walk to the Louvre/Notre Dame/Tuileries Gardens area and took a taxi to the Eiffel Tower. The A/C worked well and kept the room nicely cool. Breakfast served was not included but was great. We were able to store our bags on the day of arrival and departure.,The two adjoining rooms were absolutely perfect for our family of four‚Äîmuch more spacious than we expected! Fantastic location near metro, regional train, and bus, but quieter than near The Seine. Well staffed and safe. Highly recommended!,We were warmly welcomed by the excellent staff, who had previously kindly responded to our emails, assuring an easy arrival after a long flight from SFO to Orly. The boutique hotel was perfect for us. Small scale and intimate. Everything needed in the small very French decor room with a tub. Knowledgeable caring staff who spoke several languages and imparted wisdom of the area. Charming sweet garden courtyard that blended country with city. We walked just a few blocks down to the plaza where we had one of the best meals in France at Calice. Dining outside with the just distant enough sounds of the band in the plaza. You could find any kind of food you want in this area. We walked around, surveyed and landed in this fabulous restaurant that normally takes reservations but offered us a wonderful table outside. We walked everywhere from this location. So much was under construction, probably in advance of the Olympics, as was much of Paris. We loved being there and were happy to leave to get away from the crowds that were about to arrive for Paris 2024 Olympics. Getting to the train station upon our departure was easy with Uber too.,Hotel location and friendly and helpful staff,Hotel staff are really friendly, cozy room in a good location,Great location - easy walk to 3 metro stations including one with RER access,Friendly staff; convenient location, with a couple bus stops right out of the door and walking distance to subway station.,Lovely boutique hotel in a quiet location. We asked for a double bed in a room overlooking the street. They gave us a room on the 5th Floor so could open window without street noise. We were a bit concerned there would be street noise but we weren't impacted at all by it, and loved seeing Paris wake up.
Breakfast lovely, delicious pastries cheeses and meats, and you could cook your own boiled eggs so perfect for us.
Location excellent for sight seeing Paris and easy to use the Metro. 
Small room, but thats Paris, and we had everything we needed in it.,The hotel was well located to transport and restaurants. Safe neighbourhood. Rooms were clean and lift was an added bonus. Best of all- the staff. The staff were amazing! The friendly welcome at check in, helping me locate my lost jacket by contacting the Versailles Palace and changing our dinner reservation when we were running late, all added to our memorable stay in Paris. Highly recommend. Will definitely stay again.,This hotel is excellent. The staff were extremely friendly and very helpful. They were all very Hard Working!

Merci!,Everything was very good,Location,Helpful friendly staff,Every detail on this property was stunning. What a beautiful, quaint, very French, hotel. We loved the ‚Äúliving room‚Äú, terrace, and especially the breakfast area which was down a spiral staircase to what looked like an old wine cellar. Breakfast was delicious with many pastries, fresh fruit, eggs, sausage, ham, fresh juices (orange, apple, and grapefruit), assorted cheeses, tomatoes, coffee and tea‚Ä¶

The hotel provided quality shampoo, conditioner, lotion , and a hair dryer. The shower had great hot water and excellent water pressure. The room was small but perfect for my husband and me. We had room to open our luggage and walk around. 

The property is in a quiet area but within a 5-10 minute walk of several restaurants on Rue Mouffetard.

"16 Boulevard du Temple, 11th arr., 75011 Paris, France",LE CLARK HOTEL,"Size of the room could be bigger and better but I guess you cannot ask for more in the heart of Paris for this price.,At first it seems that the room is not big, but very quickly you will see that the room is furnished and designed so cleverly that everything just fits in and feels very comfortable. We stayed for 6 days, with a lot of luggage without any problems.,Just H√¥tel was very small and rooms were small,The overhead shower had low pressure,Nothing,Scuff marks on the paintwork by the bed (room 202).,We travelled as two friends, and we had two single beds pushed together. The space in our room was very limited. However, the bathroom was surprisingly large with a great shower.,Unfortunately I happened to visit Paris on a very warm October day and the air con had already been turned off in the hotel. So it was quite warm in the room.,The elevator didn‚Äôt work in the night.,The cleaning products and vacuum permanently littering the stairway.,Nothing,Feet were hanging off bed for my partner (could be because we were assigned the wrong room category), both sets of pillows are thick and bouncy as opposed to having one thick and one slim. So problem sleeping comfortably. No minibar which we found surprising for a four star. No telephone in the room, which seems to be a trend in hotels. But usually it‚Äôs replaced by an app that allows communication with reception. Hot water ran out in the morning and water was lukewarm. Overall nothing that cannot be sorted by having staff sleep at the hotel from time to time in order to spot issues recalibrate the service.,Nothing,Nothing,No negatives!,Coming from North America, the standard room is just a little too small - no where to put luggage or unpack clothes into closets. The junior suite is necessary.,It would have been nice to have had larger storage for longer visits,nothing,I wish there was a place to fill up my own water bottles. Otherwise, staff was very accommodating to refill water when I asked.,We thought the breakfast was overpriced for what you can get, compared to nearby cafes. But it is convenient to have breakfast in the hotel if you have an early start.,Room was small, but this is normal in Paris.,Nothing,Nothing, it great,It was all great,Small but didn‚Äôt bother us at all.,Nothing,Everything we loved,The coffee at breakfast was poor quality,Everything was great. Just a small note: the towels were replaced everyday even though we hung it up for continued use as suggested. It would be nice to have a more sustainable approach.,Breakfast,Nothing really, stairway and corridors are a bit narrow, but part of charm of the hotel.,Only negative no fridge..,We were on 6th floor which had one stair up from 5th with no elevator. At time of booking I requested to not be on that floor but still ended up with it at check in.,Nothing.,I have nothing negative to review.,Shower drain could be better, but not unuseable.,Lots of fruit flies around the fruit blending machinery,Nothing, everything was perfect!,Mattress very hard, massive pillows for size bed. Telephone next to bed but no instructions to how to call reception. Tv remote not easy to use (could just be me) . Lots of extra cushions when not a lot of space. Lobby has rattan chairs that are too big, makes the area looks odd. Breakfast at ‚Ç¨18 is nonsense, not sure why it is so high but didn‚Äôt ever get it as we walked past it.,Despite indicating I was a solo traveler the couch was made up as another bed. I upgraded my room specifically to have a sitting area and that kind of defeated the purpose. With the help of one of the staff we unmade the bed and wrestled back into the couch. All in all it wasn't that much of an issue. I would have preferred not to have to keep the key in to have the lights on,It was room for disable people without shower walls or cabin, so water was on the whole floor after showering, not very convinient. Previous family room was much better.,Some teething problems,After checkout, the staff were willing to hold bags, but let a very precious thing fall to the floor and didn't notice until I pointed it out. It's the only reason I dropped my review down from a 10 to a 9.","The staff were very kind, polite and helpful. Someone was available at the reception at all times. Very clean and comfortable room.,Le Clark Hotel is an amazing hotel! Very beautiful, cosy, super clean, great staff, everything was just perfect. We will definitely come back.

Really conveniently located and very friendly staff. Highly Recommend!,We stayed for 4 days at the start of October and we had the pleasure to see that the hotel is very well placed regarding the subway (at least 3 stations nearby), enough restaurants from all types also pretty close.
The hotel is very cosy and comfortable, everything is stylish and well designed, very clean (everyday cleaning service) and breakfast is awesome.
The staff is very nice and helpful, sorted fast everything we needed.
It was my daughter‚Äôs 18 yo birthday while we were there and on that day, when we arrived in the evening at the hotel we had a nice surprise on the bed, a big heart from flower petals on her bed‚ù§Ô∏è.

"9 - 11 Place du Colonel Fabien, 10th arr., 75010 Paris, France",Generator Paris,"Nothing,No kitchen and no bringing food in (eat ours we were told)!! For people with dietary issues this is non-negotiable as we can't eat your food!! Forcing us to eat in your restaurant is not going to ensure it happens. Sure got tired of cold grocery food. Dissatisfied. The restaurant atmosphere, table arrangements and the food rules gave the feeling you had to buy food to use the area for hanging out. No good space for meeting others and hanging out except a few spots in front of the window (terrace closed).,There is no place to sit at the reception. The bar is closed in the morning only for those who have booked breakfast and the terrace is closed in the winter.,Every other thing apart from the room came with charges. Towel: 10 euros, Padlock: 10 euros, Luggage storage: 10 euros for 6 hours; Breakfast: 10 euro; Early checkin: 10 euro etc. At the end I ended up paying almost 50 euros in addition to booking price.,Easy to get to by train but still fairly out of the city centre. Would be good to have kitchen facilities to cook our own food.,no towels,Other than some of the reception staff, who were occasionally rude (though not all of them), I was particularly disappointed that I wasn‚Äôt allowed to bring food into the room, even though the room was equipped with a table and chairs specifically designed for dining.,There is no hot water when showering, and it is October, sooooo cold.,It was all fine,None,There is no kitchen, which is unusual for a hostel. There is a restaurant though but quite expensive.,The shower and toilets were a bit dirty, although that was mostly because of my roommates, I believe. No free luggage storage services.,With kitchen it would have been better, or at least could and hot water access. I didn‚Äôt like you have to pay for leave your luggage for a few hours, because it was expensive.,the 8 beds female Dormitory's floor is a bit messy and dusty cause we have our roommates come and go everyday. In stead of asking at the front desk to send someone clean the room, they should have send the cleaner to deal with it everyday.,The hostel doesn‚Äôt have activities to make friends, some days they had but was not really nice.,I was a bit disappointed with the bar. The prices were quite steep, with a 330 ml bottle of Heineken costing 10 euros. Additionally, the pizza we ordered was lacking in quality and flavor.,Slightly far from all of the touristy things, ~25-30 min by metro,All the shower heads supports were broken in the communal showers. 
For the price of the breakfast there should have been croissants on the buffet and not as an additional extra. If you had eggs and bacon you couldn‚Äôt have a croissant.,No self-catering facilities.,The staff was unfriendly (except for the front desk, they were really nice),Not just me but my roomies also booked the place thinking the rooftop is part of the experience of booking generator paris hostel but turns out when you go to the rooftop the lady just say you have to buy a drink or something to hang over there. I also asked the staff and they confirmed so if you're booking this place thinking the same, I would recommed find somewhere else cheaper or closer once you won't have acess unless buying something at the bar.,The rooftop bar was a letdown. It is closed in the mornings, doesn't offer any non-alcoholic beverages and when I wanted to sit down for a bit there - I was told that they only serve alcoholic drinks and food, no tea or coffee and only buying customers are welcome.

It is an underutilized space in the mornings and many people would enjoy having breakfast or coffee with a nice rooftop view.,They should give you a lock and towel on arrival I felt very insecure that my luggage was open for anyone to have a go at also I stayed at the generator in Madrid before and it was way more friendly and even has a jacuzzi,the only thing is that my keycard stopped working and still didnt work even after i brought it to the front desk and they said it got fixed. had to knock and get my roommates to open the door for me many times,There is no complaint about the place,It just so happened that I‚Äôm with a bunch of youngsters in the dorm who don‚Äôt care much about others and keep on banging the doors at odd hours. It‚Äôs not the hostel‚Äôs fault.,No kitchen or microwave,The communal bathrooms don‚Äôt receive enough upkeep - between two visits at night there was no communal toilet paper,The hallways were pretty dark and it got scary certain times. We had a situation where our luggage got misplaced when we put them in the lockers but the staffs were pretty helpful in finding them. The hostel almost always had a lot of guests so if you want to check in early might be better to inform them beforehand.,I did get a few bed bug bites. I know this is not always the hostels fault as there are people coming and going. When I told the desk they were helpful providing me new linen. It was also not as social as other hostels I had stayed at.,People were running around shouting, making it impossible to sleep‚Ä¶,the outlets in each bed werent working at all and the storage for lugagge underneath the bad didnt stay lifted, usually falling down with a huge noise. food was forbidden in the room, which I understand because it can get messy quickly, but I missed my bedtime chocolate.,Firstly, the room really looked quite shabby, especially the toilet and shower - leave much to be desired. There was also an unpleasant smell in the room and it was extremely stuffy, despite the open window and the coolness outside.,The beds in the twin deluxe room were a bit uncomfortable and we were only given one towel per person and one for the floor.,room size,I was changed into a different room like 3 times when i firat arrived because they hadn't been cleaned yet but once I was in a room it was comfortable and clean. They gave me free breakfast ticket for the inconvenience. **NOTE**: GP is located in colonel fabien...not the most amazing part of town. There are alot of pick pocketers around. My phone was pickpocketed at the nearest metro and when I went to buy a burner phone in front of GP the guy told me most of the people who came to buy phones after being pickpocketed were from this hostel. Not necessarily the hostels fault, just something to be aware of. The thieves are preying on tourists, be careful in this area.,The smoking area is between the hostel and the restaurant 
No towel provided
Bed not prepared 
Small room for 8 beds, should have been a 6,No kitchen.
No real common\hang out room.
I was in the women's dorm, a male cleaner came in without making himself known at the door first, if he had just yelled out ""cleaner"" when he opened the door it would have been ok. He did say hello when he saw me.,The room we booked was supposed to be a king sized bed and yet it was 2 single beds pushed together. This was not comfortable. Also, the pressure in the shower was very low, it should be improved on as well as the temperature of the water to make for a better experience.,There was a mix up with the beds on my arrival, but everything was sorted.,A towel was hanging in the clean bed and a chocolate paper inside the little net inside the capsule.
Anyways, it's a great place, I will always reccomend.,This is my problem because I didn't check, but the place doesn't have a kitchen, so be ready to spend money on dining in the hostel's bar or outside.,Cleanliness was quote neglecty, specifically in bathrooms üöª

Nothing in between.,There is no kitchen. Not even microwave or hot water facilities in a common room. I asked for a one time cup at the hostel bar/restaurant, the staff charged ‚Ç¨0.50 for it. I have ever seen any cafe or restaurant charge for a cup like this .
The breakfast seems too expensive for a hostel. You can have decent breakfast at a posh cafe for the same price. 
The upper bunker bed was very difficult to climb into. The steps are narrow and there is no proper holding ground to balance. There is netting on the left side of the bed. So, you can only hold onto the right side, but on top. Don‚Äôt get upper bunk bed if you are short or have muscle pain,It has been advertised about a club ....but all the time the club was closed. The only time there was something there, it was a private event....and staff told me that there has never open events in this ""club""...so stop advertising this as it is open to people who are staying in the hostel. Try to clarify that it is only used for private events,Location,Too many rules feels like boarding school,paid lockers,No shelf with my bed and locker under the bed was broken (lid wouldn‚Äôt stay up),You have to pay for towels.

Bathroom just a little small but can manage.,It was close to metro and bus station. Bed was very comfortable.,The Staff ist super friendly and the location is super close to public transportation. I was disappointed with the breakfast since I expected more variety but it does its job and everything is clean and fresh. If you have heavy luggage keep in mind that there is no elevator ;),1. Breakfast was amazing. 
Not many options like 5 star hotel buffet, but the owner baked the croissants and baguette every morning. I loved the smell of fresh bread and coffee. Other items, ham, eggs, etc in the small fridge were all very nice. 
2. The location was excellent. 
It has everything such as metro, bus stops, shops, supermarkets, coin laundry, within 1-2 minutes' walking. 
I recommend taking bus to travel instead of metro(dangerous due to pickpockets) 
3. Safety issue
I found the hotel area, 14 arr, quite safe, unlike other famous travel attractions. 
Also, good place for travellers to experience real life of citizens in Paris.

Nevertheless, the rooms are freshly renovated and nicely furnished. There was even a large fan in the room which was pleasant since it was still quite warm. The common areas are also nicely decorated. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The courtyard which gives access to additional rooms is also very pleasant. Our room had windows towards the rear of the building and was surprisingly quiet. It was even possible to leave the windows open the whole night. The neighbourhood is very nice with shops, restaurants, and fast-food places nearby. The next m√©tro-station is just round the corner.,cheap,The staff is very friendly.,The staff were very accommodating and friendly to English speakers such as myself, most of them spoke English.

"86 Quai D'Austerlitz, 13th arr., 75013 Paris, France",Hotel OFF Paris Seine,"nothing,Not much . The party barge across the river with strobe lights and bass thumping until 6:00am
Best to stay Sun-Thursday. Love this location so much.,Only 1 thing - the HVAC. Weather was all over the board during our stay. And we could not get the temp to regulate in the room (one of the suites on the end). So it was either very cold (on cold mornings) or very warm (on warm afternooons).,No phone to contact reception in the room 
Location is not good if you are carrying heavy luggage, but the overall experience of ambience and view are too good and very romantic 
Taxi available but a little expensive to commute at night,Absolutely nothing,Little bit too cramped but it was awesome,It can be quite noisy in the surroundings of the hotel since the trains cross the bridge next to the hotel and there are clubs on the boats on the other side of the river with lots of music and voices, so the complimentary earplugs in the room are not a luxury. But with earplugs in and the windows closed during the night any noise was limited (my teenage kids in the next room didn‚Äôt hear anything and didn‚Äôt use any earplugs).,The room is a little cramped but understanable as space is limited on a boat.,It‚Äôs unique location and something different.,The room was a little bit small for my tastes, but still rather enjoyable.,It was hard communicating with the front desk from the Room.,The breakfast was quite average. The eggs are left out for you to cook yourself which I tried after having broken a raw egg first as I thought they were cooked eggs. The second egg didn‚Äôt cook so I had a second raw egg on my plate. There were three staff standing around and no one offered assistance.,Nothing to dislike!,Swimming pool,The location is a bit far on foot, but only across the street from Gare Austerlitz.,We loved everything.,Coffee machine not working but the problem was in 2 minutes solved by a friendly room maintenance responsible.
Vegan breakfast not so clear but still enough for a amazing meal at the sunny restaurant in the Hotel. The crew was even instantly available to low the price of the breakfast in case of an unsatisfying meal.,‚ò∫Ô∏è,Slightly isolated but some may enjoy this, beer was very expensive.,Night staff weren‚Äôt so helpful.,The pool is a little too small to be considered a true amenity, and its location in the middle of the restaurant makes it borderline unusable, but this is my single complaint.,Everything was great,Nothing to complain. People coming to this hotel need to take in consideration that is a house boat (p√©niche) therefore there will be waving, boat noise, and other specificities. I was very pleased,very small shallow pool,Maybe some information about wifi. We forgot to ask. Also our room key kept failing so we had to keep coming up to reception to get it reprogrammed. We weren't really told about food and how it works or options available to us.,It was a little far out of the main city (Eiffel Tower etc) but next to a train station so not the end of the world. The toilets were eco-friendly vacuum toilets, which is great, but were quite loud when flushed (fine normally but middle-of-the-night trips weren't ideal).,The trains riding on the bridge at 80 mtrs every 5/10 min from the boat was super noisy killing its magic when there was no music,Small rooms and should have a stocked fridge for drinks.,Not a single bad word to say, it‚Äôs probably one of my favourite trips :),Be warned that there is a metro train bridge just by the hotel - bring earplugs so you can sleep without it disturbing you. A train comes by every minute or two. The breakfast was a little pricey at 22 euros a person (even children) - it was a good breakfast, but that is a little steep. My kids really wanted to try out the little pool, but the pool is only open when the restaurant is not open....that's not very much. So we never got to jump in the pool. We were hoping for early check-in, but that was not available.,Nice design,Bar straight across from room and there was a party going on until midnight but tbh, you don‚Äôt visit Paris for an early night üòâ,Nothing really, train noise with window open .,The shower facilities didn't provide enough privacy,Nothing springs to mind.,There was no area to workout / gym.,Breakfast could be a little more healthy. More fresh fruit perhaps.,Dark route arriving by taxi, due to Olympic lane closures. Also, the modern trend of open shower areas (albeit more than adequate) is not for everyone!,A little better lighting in the rooms, especially the area above the sink, it's quite dark against the black walls and decor.,Loved everything!,nothing it was great,Wish the pool hours could be extended.,Cost of food and drinks,Nothing,Rooms are very small (as expected) and you can feel the movement of the water.,No problems to report,Location was little far from everything. 1,5 walk to the Eiffel.,Limited storage space,Just a personal opinion: the toilet and the shower are combined (so far it‚Äôs ok) but they are separated by the sliding door (which doesn‚Äôt separate you from the room completely) and a curtain from the rest of the room. Going to the toilet is uncomfortable in terms of privacy as it feels like you do your thing just in front of your partner.","just great spot and quite unexpected
nothing,Breakfast was great. Staff was superb.,very cozy and modern. A really unique stay.,This was so unique! A completely memorable experience. And so convenient! Easy to get to from CDG. And so easy to navigate the city.,A unique hotel in a great location.,Next to River

Location is perfect, a stroll from Gare d‚ÄôAusterlitz so by metro you‚Äôre in the busy city center in no time. Jardin des
Plantes is around the corner and if you excercise, don‚Äôt forget to bring your trainers to have a run along the Seine or swimsuit to have a swim at the piscine municipal Josephine Baker among the locals. The staff of the hotel is super friendly and helpful, we had some issues with the safe in the room and the issue was solved immediately. In the evening we wanted to have a drink at the bar but unfortunately the bar was closed for a private event and the guy from the reception got us drinks on the house. The interior of the hotel was clean and stylish and there was a nice and small photo exhibition in the common room. The hotel room was clean, small and efficiently furnished (with a separate toilet from the shower) and the windows of the room could be opened for fresh air. We didn‚Äôt make use of any breakfast/lunch at the hotel, nor made use of the hotel pool. There was a functional safe and fridge in the room. I highly recommend this hotel.,Beautiful view of the seine, in an amazing central location. Really helpful staff and a great experience.,Its location to the train station.,The decor, view, the pool being open for a midnight swim, and the location across the street from Austerlitz Station.,Service was excellent.

Perfect location! Wish we could have stayed longer,Clean ,the stuff are good and beautiful perfect view,The staff were very friendly. Although the rooms were small they were very comfortable and we all slept well. The location was great. We liked the location for two reasons: it was easy walking distance to the Gare de Lyon, which is how we left Paris. And it was easy walking distance to the Batobus, the hop-on, hop-off boat up and down the Seine River. The view of the river is beautiful, although our view did have bright orange construction rope due to the set up for the Olympics.,Special location!,Location to station and quirkiness. Very modern.,Great for train access, and loved the bar over the way.,The hotel rooms was perfect for 2 people,A short walk from Gare de Lyon with an excellent restaurant, and there‚Äôs a lovely common area in the middle of the boat where you can wile away an hour with a coffee and a good book.,Staff were friendly and helpful. Room was clean and lovely views.,Its location was both beautiful, being right on the Seine,and convenient, being right across from Gare D‚ÄôAusterlitz. It was fun to see the boat traffic right from the water. The staff could not have been nicer nor more helpful. If my eight year old grandson was writing this review, he would be sure to mention the pool, which he loved.,Excellent staff from first phone call, throughout reception, bar, breakfast, to assistance with my case (I use walking aid) across the road to Gare D'Austerlitz on checkout.

The hotel had recently opened, decoration and furnishings were immaculate. Receptionist was very welcoming . Bedrooms looked on to the Seine River Quay( other rooms looked on to the river) , bathroom and separate toilet were very clean with modern fittings.

But as the stairs are a few hundred years old I can understand them not wanting to change them,Nothing we didn't like but be prepared for the stairs! And there is an elevator if needed.,We thought it was great- very authentic! we were very comfortable but just wanted to warn that it‚Äôs tiny and the stairs are crooked (it‚Äôs a very old building) so if you are obese or mobility impaired, maybe not for you.,Small bathroom.,Nothing,We paid full price as we booked in advance to stay during Olympics. It was on offer late at a substantial discount.,Rooms could use some updating, especially in bathroom such as getting into the bathtub area access and water that spills outside of shower.,The building is old and awkward and the room small (but hey, that‚Äôs Paris!)

It‚Äôs just a jacuzzi in the basement -no wellness area, no treatments, no sauna etc. it‚Äôs a tiny hotel so seeing hotel & spa creates the wrong expectation.,No faults for me,got charged a reservation fee and whole price of trip as listed on booking.com and not been refunded so significantly more expensive than advertised.,Is a small hotel... very small...,Nothing,Room was a little small - but it‚Äôs Paris so you expect that.,Room service menu is limited,Rooms are tiny, like VERY tiny, but they‚Äôre nice.,Nothing,The rooms we had were very small, with barely enough room to navigate around the bed. Neither my nor my wife's room had a comfortable lounge chair nor enough room to easily set up my computer. So, I sat in my bed to use the computer. We fortunately rented two rooms, one for each of us to have enough space. Even with the space limitation we enjoyed ourselves.

Hotel also prepared a compliment it was so nice ‚ù§Ô∏è,Friendly staff, beautifully decorated reception area, cosy rooms and such a comfortable bed!,The stuff was excellent, the room was clean.,We were touring northern Europe for 2 weeks. For the first week, traveling through Netherlands and Belgium, we used Booking.com to find some excellent hotels. For a full week in Paris, we planned to settle into a VRBO/Guest Ready Apartment. The VRBO apartment was a disaster, and as soon as we had that nightmare over with, and that rental canceled, we sat down on a bench at The Louvre and used the Booking.com app to find this hotel. It was just down the street from Musee D'Orsay, and just across the river from The Louvre--a perfect location for sightseeing Paris, which we did mostly on foot. When we arrived, the lobby was very nice, and very clean. The staff was friendly and attentive, pointing us to an excellent French restaurant just a block away. Our room was exceptionally nice, and the staff always kept it perfectly clean. When you travel Europe, and stay in the older parts of the cities, the hotel rooms are not as big as a U.S. airport hotel, but the room in this hotel was plenty large for my wife and me. Next time we're in Paris, we're staying there again.,Hotel Vinci Due & Spa is an absolute gem in the heart of Paris!

The location is one block off the Seine River across from the west end of the louve, and 2 blocks from the Museum De Orsay. Easy walking distance to St Michelle restaurant district. If you are going to Versailles the RER line C station is under the Museum De Orsay so it is an easy shot to get to that attraction as well as the Eiffel Tower. The breakfast was very solid with eggs and bacon available. The staff person was very attentive. Front desk personnel were very helpful also. The only issue I had was the morning of checkout the hotel receptionist had told me we were getting a private car to take us to the train station, and the fixed rate would be 24 Euros. The morning of pickup we had a regular taxi show up and when we got to the station the cab driver charged me double the rate. Not really the hotel receptionists fault but the communication could have been better.,Fantastic staff, wonderful central location and great breakfast spread.

Located on a quiet street in the 5th ARR - past some other, not as nice looking hotels - you enter into the stylish lobby, full of verdant prints and plants and head to the front desk where you will be greeted by one of the amazing staff members. The check in process was simple the staff gave me the quick overview - there was the inner courtyard, the downstairs lounge, and below that the breakfast area.

My room was perfectly sized for a single traveler, but might have been a bit cramped for two. The room came with a full-sized bed, there was a desk and area to put up clothes & store things, as well as the large bathroom. I had a courtyard facing room, so it was very quiet at all times. The shower was large and featured a door so no worries about water getting everywhere. The room comes with a complimentary water, and a charged at the end minibar. Do recommend you ask for refills on water, especially during the summer

Buy the daily breakfast! You either take the elevator, or from the lobby take the stairs down to the lounge and through a door to another set of stairs. You find yourself in an intimate area with two rooms, the longer one also featuring the buffet. Absolutely worth it to have a selection of fresh croissants, breads, meats, cheeses, smoked salmon, eggs, sausage, cereal, muffins, and more. I made croissant sandwiches with the fresh cheese and meats, and also with just butter and jam. There is only one direct coffee maker, so sometimes lines will form. Just be patient.

Finally the location here is amazing. A short walk from the Saint-Michel Notre-Dame, which also means you are a short walk from Notre-Dame and Saint Michel statue. You're about a 20 minute walk from the beautiful Jardin du Luxembourg, about 30 minutes to the Louvre.,Nice cute hotel. Centrally located in a good neighborhood. Building renovated very well.

"108 Rue Monge, 5th arr., 75005 Paris, France",H√¥tel de France Quartier Latin,"The air conditioning in my room was broken when I stayed there, the hostel went installed portable air conditioning in the room before I checked in. Also I didn't find the light switch in the bathroom at the time of my stay, but that could have been my own problem.,Lift.,Construction in the area,I know I paid for the cheapest room rather last minute so I cannot complain too much but the room was really rather small with not much wiggle room in the bathroom (I kept getting tangled up with the shower curtain for example). The 'court-yard view' really was just a window that looked out at a wall and other windows a couple yards away so I had my curtains drawn most of the time. That said, it did make it quieter to sleep, without traffic noises outside.,Nothing,The bathrooms are a bit dated but works for what you need them for.,Unfortunately the downsides to our stay was our room wasn‚Äôt great. The bed was very hard, there was a huge hole in the ceiling above a light so looked like something had caught fire? And also the air conditioning/heater had wires bare and had just been sprayed with expanding foam so didn‚Äôt look very safe. The shower curtain was way too short for the shower so every night we showered we ended up having puddles of water everywhere, not very good long term as it will mess up the flooring. The room just was a bit outdated and considering we were staying for our honeymoon we were a bit dissatisfied. When we arrived we were told that the little tea/coffee bar in the breakfast room was available complimentary to us after 12pm but that meant no kettle in the room and as someone who likes to have a cup of tea in the morning that was disappointing.,Breakfast was a little bit poor, no vegetables and little fruits,It‚Äôs a bit small for a family. No fridge.,Not really much to say when you realize youre in an ancient renovated building, the bathroom was quite small but ok for a solo traveler, the wall were thin and you could hear your neighbors noise from other rooms when bathing or flushing the toilets but i dont understand because this is Paris not Dubai. Overall it was a good place for 2-3 nights. WIFI wasn't so fast but per my IT knowledge its bcos of how the rooms are demarcated. Blockages of the signals but thats what i used for all my official duties successfully. Beds are very comfortable and clean. House keeping were always eager to change your towel for you with no issues. Overall its a nice place with good value for money.,Room 28 bathroom door is too tight for the doorway, gets jammed shut. I didn't like their shower gel but it's free so I can't be too upset. Windows had blackout blinds but no privacy blinds so I had to choose between light and public or dark and private.,n/a,The only minor drawback was occasional noise from neighboring rooms, but it didn't significantly impact my overall satisfaction.

The room was very small and we faced challenges to open our luggage at the room.,Room N.18 was the smallest room we have ever seen. And the lightening was very poor. Though it was clean and the bed was super comfortable. Cleaning was done everyday. Thank you),Tiny bathroom - particularly shower,I like to read before going to sleep but the two bed lamps were both out of order.But that was it !,Very small room,üòä,everything was great but no refrigerator available.,The bathtub was very high and there aren‚Äôt handrails,nothing,I did not realize beforehand that the breakfast was not included, so just be aware of that. They also recently raised the price to 12 euros. The breakfast was alright, but at that price, you could find something nice at a nearby cafe. At the price point of this hotel, it just seemed that breakfast should definitely be included. The wifi also did not work properly. I had a lot of problems with my connection.,I wanted a room that had a view, but the only view that i got was white building walls.,The only thing I can fault but it's a minor quibble is the overhead lighting in my room. But that's the type of thing that would require major overhaul. This is a sweet & slightly quirky little gem. It was just fine for me.,rooms small,No complaints,very small room,small room and during our stay there, there was a short power supply issues.,small room,the room was a bit tight, and we didnt have a nice view.,a bit aged and need a facelift,they didn‚Äôt vacuum the floor when cleaning the room,it said an iron was available but I couldn‚Äôt get one,The elevator was in construction.,We liked it all! We were very happy with this hotel!,Only minor points: The shower is relatively small. You will hear hear other residents, for instance walking on the corridor but it was still pretty quiet during my stay. For Paris, this is probably common, especially if you want to stay in a central location.,very small rooms, and the key card newer worked more than 24 hours before it should be recoded again.,All good. Room a little small but very comfortable.,There isn't refrigerator in the rooms.,Access to ice would have been great,There was no breakfast. Tea, coffee, juice & biscuits were available & free.,The walls are paper thin, so you can hear absolutely everything. No breakfast.,At the beginning of the night it was a bit noisy, but around 11pm everything was calm.,Small room but considering this is Paris it was alright. In Paris there are particular power sockets and I would have preferred the staff to have a solution to every kind of power socket. I also asked for an iron but I never received it, so there was a lack of interest to really help the guest.,price has gone up quite a bit from the year before,I liked everything.,Room small and a little noisy as on main route,Location,The room is really small, there was barely room for one big suitcase.,no kettle inside the room, tiny but clean., the elevator is outdated barely fits 2 people . the juice machine doesn't work","Conveniently located with a bus stop across the street and only a one to two minute walk to the metro station. Close to a number of attractions, you can walk to the Pantheon and Notre Dame, notably the hostel is close to Ernest Hemingway's flat in Paris, and the neighbourhood around the hostel is very nice.
The staff at the hostel were very welcoming and friendly. The room is cleaned every day.,Close to every thing, food, the Metro is one minute walk! The hotel is In the 5th district! Walking distance to the Pantheon, Luxemburg Garden, 
 5 minutes in car to Notre Dam 
Frendly staff! Specialy Mr. Gaston in the front desk who I will be for ever greatfull, because I broke my food and he cary me in and out of the taxi and to an from the elevator puting a chair in the elevator so I could seat, and then he ran up the stairs to the 3 third floor to take me out of the elevator, and take me to my room because I could not walk, and he even got me ice for my broken foot! An the cleaning ladys were very nice too, they would bring me breakfast to the room!,Location is spot on. Nice breakfast, lovely and quiet. Clean and nice cleaning staff.,The staff was very accommodating and helpful,Staff were helpful and my room was clean with a comfortable bed that was made for me while I was out exploring Paris. The hotel is located in a nice area with lots of restaurants to explore and cultural sites not too far a walk away (the Roman arena, pantheon, Jardin du Luxembourg...). The hotel is set just down the road from Censier-Daubenton metro which was very handy for navigating my way around the city. I appreciated the ready luggage storage facility when checking in and out of the hotel. Facilities like AC, TV and hot water worked well.,Location is great 
Very small room,Location,The location was great, the room was small but it is all you need. It was more than enough for me and my mother.

Food were fresh and tasted very good. The chef was very friendly and was helpful.,Comfy bed, plenty of room, had a little table if you needed to work, had decent WiFi and the staff were surprisingly kind and spoke good English, which is definitely not what I expect in Paris. I also got a free upgrade from single bed to double bed without asking. Location is excellent too.,Chic, welcoming staff and in a superbly convenient location,I recently had the pleasure of staying at H√¥tel de France Quartier Latin and had a fantastic experience. The staff was exceptionally friendly and accommodating, making check-in a breeze. The room was clean, well-maintained, and offered a breathtaking view of the Quartier Latin.

In regards to the safety, Latin Quartier is considered as one of the safest neighborhood in Paris. I did not fell unsafe at all. Metro Station is 1-min walking distance from the hotel.

The only minor drawback was occasional noise from neighboring rooms, but it didn't significantly impact my overall satisfaction. I would highly recommend H√¥tel de France for anyone visiting the area and looking for a top-notch accommodation experience. Can't wait to return on my next trip!
The room was very small and we faced challenges to open our luggage at the room.,Location was excellent. Supermarket next to the Hotel, metro 150m away, Boulangerie 200m.

And on my next trip I would choose the same hotel. Thank you for everything.,The Latin Quarter is very beautiful, and seemed more tranquil and obviously safe than the other areas , though full of shops and restaurants. Metro line 7 is about 3 mins walk, (you won‚Äôt use a bus in Paris)) There is a Carrefour near the hotel and many other grocery shops. It‚Äôs about 30 mins walk to Notre Dame. 
The staff was nice, the hotel itself is small and very very quiet.,Ensemble correct
Personnel sympathique,Great location and friendly staff,There was a friendly welcome in a hotel which I knew from the past but which has now been refurbished,which improved it and the price is still very reasonable.The room was small (but perfectly formed ;) : everything was there to make a summer visit enjoyable) But I didn't come for the room but for the excellent location : Metro, supermarket ,restaurants and coffeshops all within close walking distance.,Perfect location, steps away from metro station.
Next to a convenience store and in front of cafes and restaurants. It has elevator! So being on the top floor with a beautiful view was no trouble.

I liked the location as well.,Great location, right next to a supermarket, restaurants and a metro station.,Room and location were perfect. Exactly what was needed for one night. Spotlessly clean and the welcome free hot beverage was a nice touch. As a rule, I don't eat breakfast, preferring to do so when out and about, hence I couldn't rate the breakfast offered.,Perfect location. Near to the bus stops and metro station. Being a female solo traveller that area felt safe. Since paris is not a safe city, but this area is comparatively safer. Also, it is near to local stores, cute caf√©s and restaurants.,This 2* hotel is something of a gem. Yes the room was a bit small but (a guess that others were similarly sized to mine) but very clean, with excellent welcoming staff. It was a very comfy bed & pillows. While my room was on the street side, I couldn't hear any traffic outside (triple-glazed windows!). The location is so easy for both public transport & walking to any number of places, galleries, parks, etc. The breakfast (an add-on) is definitely worthwhile, filling, good choice. Coffee/tea, available noon to midnight & of course, wifi. Bathroom a bit small but had bathtub, shower, hairdryer; a small closet to hang clothes & a small safe. The staff are, without exception, friendly & 'there to help'. There was a question whether I would recommend for a romantic get-away; I answered 'yes' because while all the above is true, if you're a young couple (or even an older couple!) on a budget, there are many wonderful sights, galleries, museums, restaurants to be more romantic. Cheers!,friendly, clean, coffee machine,Great location comfortable tables coffee afternoon,Good,great neighborhood.,Excellent stay! The room was clean and so was the bathroom! Housekeeping was great.

"11 rue de Tr√©vise, 9th arr., 75009 Paris, France",H√¥tel Diva Opera,"The room was incredibly small. But loved the bathroom,Better restaurant on site. Early checkin option,Well it's a small hotel, so there is no large lounge to sit in and the breakfast is taken in the entrance lounge, and breakfast is a little limited - a bit pricey for what you get. Nevertheless, it is good quality, and ""bottomless"". The rooms are not large - but I understand that is a Parisienne thing. Nothing wrong with the room - it was amply comfortable.,Rooms are a bit small,The room space was not big as expected from the image shown in the site.,The lift was out of order for most of our 3 day stay and we had to climb 6 flights of stairs every time. No assistance or compensation for the inconvenience of having to climb the stairs for the majority of our trip.,I wanted a bigger room, and instead of upgrading me, I had to cancel my booking and pay $230. Then rebook the bigger room.,the room was small probably decent size for centre Paris
I would love to have vegetables at breakfast,Missing a gym but it's already mine.,Only small issue was the lift broke down which after a long day of walking/sight seeing was not great. But couldn‚Äôt be helped and didn‚Äôt spoil our stay. The engineer was on site very next morning.,The staff was great about calling taxi‚Äôs for us, but there was no close by taxi Stand Being senior citizens having a stand nearby would have been welcome. Otherwise-all was great!,We didn‚Äôt have wifi the first night but it was not a big problem and the king-size bed where 2 single beds together but it was comfortable. We would definitely comeback again,Air con wouldn‚Äôt work, fan in bathroom wouldn‚Äôt turn off and kept me awake. Room a bit on small side.,Room a bit small, but that‚Äôs Paris,- There was no electric socket near to the mirror was difficult to use my hair dryer

Not everyone has a cell phone. I'm visually impaired cannot use them. Didn't like making calls in public on house phone. Shameful!!!!!!!!!!,Breakfast, nothing special for 14euros,The only thing it didn‚Äôt like, and it was minor, was that we arrived around 1:00pm and our room was ready. Since checking was not until 2:00-2:30, if we wanted to check in an hour early there was going to be a charge of 30.00euros even though the room was ready. This was very disappointing since the 
hotel was not inexpensive. Check out was noon and we left at 8:00am, we weren‚Äôt compensated for leaving early so you should be be charged to check in an hour early when the room was available. I hate petty charges.,The front desk staff were stand-offish and just general not helpful,I don‚Äôt like the blue door it‚Äôs confusing when entering inthe building,Not much at all.,The shower would always flood the bathroom, but we did work out we had to have it on low to not.,The bed was a bit small.,Fusty smell from cupboard where the coffee tray was kept, we didn't use any tea/coffee at all due to this , however we didn't report this so maybe they would have sorted it, we didn't want to make a fuss, , were happy to go elsewhere for morning coffee etc,,Nothing.,No bar fridge which made it hard to keep drinks cold.,nothing.,Elevator and reception room very small,Very small rooms. When my friend arrived at the hotel first she asked if she can do an early checkin, only 30 min before checkin time, they said no, but a friend of hers came and asked the reception staff in French they immediately said yes. Also, we asked for an iron and for ice on 2 different ocassions and both times they said they can't bring them to our room because they are busy and that we should go to reception to get the items, and when we went to the reception there were 2 staff... so I guess one of them could have deliveres the items.,Everything was to my satisfaction - no complaints.,There was no fridge in room.

Wifi also worked very well.,The hotel is lovely, albeit the rooms are small. I opted for the balcony, and was given the largest one, and was worth the upgrade.

"78 Boulevard Ornano, 18th arr., 75018 Paris, France",Kyriad Paris 18 - Porte de Clignancourt - Montmartre,"Breakfast was a bit pricey for the quality.,The area,Int he hotel nothing really - we had to move the kettle closer to the plug and it could do with a little more light down stairs if l am being picky. 

The area can be busy especially at night , there is a tram transport hub at the top of the road. It ebbed and flowed with business as sometimes the street was very quiet( mainly during the morning / day) However 
At first we were a bit worried at night but we got used to it very quickly and felt ok after the first night - as a female on my own l would not have been so comfortable or with small children. But the hotel is great and very easy to get to the centre 15-20 mins on the metro. This also means if you have eaten out elsewhere and head back late you have a road to cross and you are at the hotel- no need to wander the street.,Too small so hard to move inside,The shower door and drain were broken.,A fridge would have been great.,The location is not nice. We did not feel safe in this area,We'd have liked a mini fridge in the room.,no complaints,My first room was very tiny but was changed for me within hesitation,Noise cancellation between the room and the hallways wasn't great, and we were on the ground floor near the lift, so could hear people coming and going frequently. Room a little dated, no fan in the bathroom so it got a little damp.,Given room with disabled bathroom. Shower flooded floor every time we used it.,Some snack vending machines options would have been nice,Nothing!,The location is not very friendly especially in the night.,Nothing,The immediate area when you step out of hotel but did not impact on visit and would stay again.
There is a lovely patisserie a couple of doors down and a great market a short walk away.,Quite expensive, due to Olympics.,The area looks a little dangerous at night,Nothing,I was happy with everything, nothing that I haven‚Äôt enjoyed.
Thank you,Everything was fine.,N/A,The only truly bothersome thing was not having any toiletries whatsoever apart from a liquid soap dispenser next to the sink. The soap dispenser wasn't accessible from the tub. Even a small solid hand soap would have been helpful when taking a shower.,It took near 40 minutes to reach the city center,The fact that the safe would not work out could be fixed. 
Not to have a selection of teas and a complimentary bottle of water in the room.,Only downside is that room 111 window opens out on the smoking section. A weird choice to allow people to smoke underneath there. But luckily we have only 1 smoker so the room didn't smell like it after leaving the window open.,Didn‚Äôt like the street where the property was,didn‚Äôt look safe especially when you have to pay 5 euros tax per night to stay in Paris , should look a lot better but that is all up to the community , overall really really pleased with it .,Not a good area at night,Distance from centre was a drawback but I would stay there again if price was right.,Breakfast was not that good. Poor choice but it was ok.,No adverse comments,First night there was a weird smell, not sure if it was sewage or another room but it disappeared in the morning. It was on our floor outside our room but did leak in at times. it was noticeable but I personally didn‚Äôt find it overwhelming,We enjoyed our stay very much. The only thing that I could mention as a negative is that I didn't feel very at ease in the neighborhood at night.,Hair dryer isn‚Äôt working, wi-fi is weak.,Very noisy when People been out and room next to lift,Just to mention something, the smell of the breakfast area was too strong, like a very chemical scent.,Noisy stairway. Needs work on it to deaden the sound. Notice‚Äôs reminds to guest to keep noise down in communal areas particularly at night.,We asked for slippers that they didnt have but honestly it is not written that they provide it, so this is only suggestion,We did not have a fridge in room but it is probably because of the space. As we didn't spend much time in the room and ate outside all of the time it was ok.,The WiFi was a bit slow,Could have had some milk in the room for adding to the tea & coffee.,There was a lingering smell in our bathroom.
The hotel is close to public transport but the area around the nearby subway felt very unsafe.,Great Location,Bathroom door didn't close or lock
Toilet roll holder falling off the wall,No comments.,Nothing,Nothing. The only minor complaint was the shower water didn't drain very quickly, which meant you couldn't use the showers on full power.","really minimalistic area and cozy,I was very pleased of the location, very close to train station access, bus stops, restaurants etc. Staff was professional and friendly.,Clean and tidy rooms and very friendly staff.

"7 rue Beudant, 17th arr., 75017 Paris, France",Paris j'Adore Hotel & Spa,"Nothing to not like!,Location in relation to Paris sites, access to spa services was very limited and hard to secure.,Issue with the heating, staff unable to fix.. cold during the night but apart from that amazing!,Honestly, nothing....
Paying for it I guess! But it was definitely worth the money.,Wished to use the pool, but it was only available as part of the Spa package, which I did not wish to use.,The Nesspresso machine too a while to work out, not something I'm used to. Should have asked for different pods from the first day. everything else was great.,Nothing,Nothing,Tech was very hard to work,Everything was sensational.,There are a few minor things the hotel can improve on to give the 5* feel. The room had free tea and coffee, but in my experience, all 5* hotels offer water as well. There were some issues with the tub as well, as it would not fill in properly - it was half-empty and it was not possible to make it full, which of course, slightly ruined the experience. We were also surprised that the lunch and dinner menu was Italian and not French. The food was good (but not mindblowing) ‚Äì 4/5.,The jacuzzi was not working in the room, so we had to move to another room.,Breakfast way over priced for what you get. Would not recommend paying for it. Also coffee machine in room barely stocked and when asked for more milk I only got 2,The hotel is a bit pricey and breakfast wasn't included.,Loved everything,Room was big enough, but even bigger would have been even better.,Only one thing, my wife had a 50 minute massage, had to move 10 minutes into it to top floor room which was cold due to the original room double booked, rather spoiled the whole thing, masseuse very apologetic,All was great could not fault the staffing or the hotel,- Hot tub was not functioning one night of our visit, but they quickly fixed it after a quick call to the desk.
- The View from the room was nothing to write home about, and you could clearly see the hot tubs on the balconies of the rooms below ours. That might not bother you, but it is something to be aware of if you book one of the rooms with an outdoor hot tub.

Not really a strong negative, but the elevator system is a bit odd. You can press the call button, but if someone else is in the elevator the button will reset itself. Interesting design quirk that I could see being annoying if the hotel is more crowded.,The facet for the shower was tricky at first. However, once we got that figured out, it was so easy to navigate. Thank you.,The room was not as big as the photographs would suggest and it‚Äôs expensive.,Only complaint would be that breakfast doesn't start until 8am. We had paid for breakfast but had to check out at 7 so had asked if perhaps we could be given a ""packed"" breakfast but that wasn't possible.,Nothing,Hair shampoo brand,Room service was inconsistent. It was perfect one day but far too slow the next day. The staff was overall very accommodating, however.,Nothing that we didn‚Äôt t like!,New Year Eve could be more organised 
Chef is excellent but food came just warm, not hot enough,Location,Could have coat hanging facility near the door,Nothing,we had a late check in as the room wasn't ready, because the previous guests had made an mess of the room. but all was handled well and the room was immaculate when we eventually got it.,Price quality it was perfect, I loved everything about the restaurant,Nothing,More wardrobe/ drawer space required.,Breakfast service very slow,Nothing,Genuinely nothing,That it wasn‚Äôt my home lol :-),Nothing,Room was maybe a tad hot even with the temperature set but nothing much else,It‚Äôs not immediately convenient to all of the sites but if you are adventurous enough it‚Äôs perfectly fine. With the Metro right by and using the local G7 taxi service, everything was easily within reach and we never felt unsafe.,Nothing,Breakfast and coffe not good enough,ŸÇ,Long walk to shopping,Nothing.,Neighborhood is so so, but at least it's short distance to all areas of the city by public transport.,The negatives are almost not worth mentioning but I think the high price paid for the room does allow for them to be mentioned. 
The hotel itself was a little bit out of the way and didn‚Äôt feel overly safe at night when returning. 
The hotel restaurant and bar was not busy and had little to no atmosphere so we didn‚Äôt hang around the hotel much even though we did plan on doing so. 
On arrival a few things were already used in the mini bar so we had to inform reception. 
The jacuzzi bath was so extremely hot you have to plan to run it and use it later. 
There are some great technology points on the iPad but I think the ‚Äòaromas‚Äô in our room had ran out as we did not get any scents that we could tell.,Nothing except we didn‚Äôt get stay long enough to enjoy it properly-restaurant, spa etc,nothing.,no body lotion in the bathroom, no water for the coffee machine, breakfast not included","The most incredible up market luxury boutique hotel with extremely spacious suites and magnificent bathrooms.

Lovely room and spa was great! Just had an overall great stay!,The property and the room with the jacuzzi tub and electronic features was great! The staff was amazing! While the AC wasn‚Äôt as cold as I am use to the staff was very helpful and accommodating. They gave me a bedside fan that helped out tremendously. I really appreciated their help and patience with me. The bar/restaurant had some good breakfast options and were fine with me asking for a small bucket of ice occasionally :). 

It was our 21st anniversary and they were able to prepare the room with rose petals on the bed and a bucket of cold champagne, with a cost of course. It was a nice option to have. The location was right near two metro stations. As with most areas there were plenty of restaurants and bakeries within walking distance. 

We also booked time at the spa and for a couples massage. The spa was quite nice and the staff there was also very friendly and helpful. This worked out amazing after several days of walking and exploring the sites. 

Overall, if you want a comfortable stay with an overall amazing staff, friendly to non-French speaking travelers, I cannot recommend this place more.,Decore. Service. Rooms were stunning. Cocktails.

Good position for an early flight from CDG with taxi ride under 30 minutes.

Hard to open up two suitcases at a time.,The bed was a little ""too big"" for the room, it blocked the window/way out to the balcony and so you had to sort of climb awkwardly to get out.

And ofc, with it being an old building some areas (like the shower) were more for shorter people and my 6""3 partner had to slouch a bit.,Room is a bit too small for 2 people.,All was good,All good,Room bit on the small size but much better than others in Paris,Rooms were very, very small with no space at all for luggage but we knew that before reserving the room. Staying more than three days in such a small room is challenging. If you understand that ahead of time you will love the hotel,The decor was a little tired in our room. Lots of marks on the wallpaper etc. The rooms are on the small side, but the location more than makes up for this.,Nothing,Rooms are very tiny,low lighting in room,Nothing,Bathroom size,Nothing,The sound proofing was a little poor. We could hear noises from the people next and above us,Small rooms,Not enough surfaces to put things on, bath tub at weird angle so you had to shimmy past it to get into bathroom.

However, this was to be expected somewhat, in a house-like boutique hotel. The charm and elegance were worth it though, since we didn't spend much time in our room. If you're traveling with a lot of luggage and extra large suitcases, you should book a larger room.,Everything was great!,Nothing,Room was a little dark to apply make up !,Need a handrail in the bathtub for safety.

If I have to come up with something, there was a persistent mild drain smell in the shower (mildew smell) even though the shower itself was very clean. The drains probably need some cleaning. To be expected in building of that age.,the only thing is the small rooms, but in this beautiful city anyway you don‚Äôt stay too much time at the hotel,nothing we didn‚Äôt like,Nothing,no yea coffee making facilities,nothing, it was perfect.,Check in time was 3pm, but we had to wait 1.5 hours for our room to be ready at 4.30pm. It wasn't hard, cuz we could walk around the many shops in the Marais - but we were tired after a long trip and wanted to freshen up. There's a lift - which is good - but it's very slow - so make sure you allow enough time to go up / down. The corridors are narrow - expected for a hotel of this heritage, but it means you will have to hop over vacuum hoses when housekeeping is in action.","beautifully appointed in a terrific location. the service was impeccable‚Äîfriendly, helpful, welcoming. we also loved the location we n the Marais.,Location, excellent staff,Interior decor, exceptional and friendly service,Great location!!

We will be back.,I loved my stay at this hotel! The entire place has an incredibly chic Parisian feeling. My room wasn‚Äôt huge, but it was the perfect size for me as a solo traveler and it had everything I needed, including a cute balcony. The location was also great. There a ton of cute restaurants and shops and you are close to the subway. It‚Äôs a great place to stay to truly embrace the Paris experience.,The cosy boutique feel of this hotel mixed with it‚Äôs cool Parisian high end luxe interior is what brought me back to stay for a second time at Bourg Tibourg. The scented candles at reception and soft sound of the water fountain in the courtyard give a spa like atmosphere. The beds are so comfortable and rooms are a reasonable size by Paris standards. Location is the best in Le Marais in my opinion‚Ä¶ with restaurants and shops all around but also so close to the Siene river which I love to walk to just for the view. The staff are all very friendly and accommodating, they made a reservation in advance for us at a restaurant that is very difficult to get a booking at.

We stayed in a Junior Suite and had plenty of room for the two of us. The room was very clean and comfortable.

But it would be nice if they put up signs asking people to be quiet and respectful of the other diners. Of course, it's great that the kids were enjoying themselves in Paris!

The bathrooms are VERY small. 
It was really noisy. Both inside and outside. 

We were in Room 14 at the bottom and from early morning on there were a lot of doors slamming constantly and loud talking of staff/people. Either people were unaware of how loud the doors are slamming or they are just inconsiderate. I am expecting that it may be staff as there was only one other room on that floor and you barely heard anyone.

Provides exceptional access to everything.
Cool view of Paris.,Timhotel in Montmartre is a small but 3 story hotel located in a lovely neighborhood which is walkable to every place you‚Äôd like to explore in Montmartre. We arrived upon this area on Labour Day , 5/1/24 and it was very crowded as all of Paris was. Even with the crowds the charm of this area prevailed. Restaurants, shops, Sacre Coeur etc! 
Our rooms were on the smaller side but very well appointed with lovely crisp clean beddings and an updated bathroom. The floor to ceiling windows that opened up looking out onto the tree lined square added to the ambiance. 
The front desk staff was very helpful holding our bags for us for 2 hours since we arrived earlier than check in time which was 2 pm. The staff ordered a taxi for us the day before our departure in order to get us to the airport. You can imagine my surprise when our taxi driver was actually a staff member from the hotel who drove us in his nice private car. It was $60 euros which my friend and I split. I wish I could remember the drivers name. He was a very friendly and professional, helpful man to my friend and I who are in our 70‚Äôs and needed help lifting our suitcases. 
And before I forget, the included breakfast was perfect. Everything we expected, eggs, bacon , yogurt( lots of varieties), fruit, breads, croissants and even mini crepes and a big jar of Nutella next to it. Tea and coffee if course!!

Rooms are small but they are equipped with all you can think of. They are comfy as well and have a great atmosphere. I was very pleasantly surprised. The hotel is situated in great location, surrounded by narrow streets with small shops and excellent local bistros, cafes and small restaurants. The basilica Sacr√©-Coeur is only 5 min walk from the hotel and the famous Moulin Rouge you can reach in 10 min. Next time I'm in Paris I'm gonna stay here again :),Perfect location. Cozy clean room.

"13 Boulevard Du Temple, 3rd arr., 75003 Paris, France",1K Paris,"literally nothing! it was perfect,Could use some updates,Nothing,The restaurant and taco bar felt a bit abandoned. No music, no vibe, a bit grubby, uncomfortable seats, not an amazing dinner menu either , so we never ate there, other than the breakfast which was included. 
Such a pity because it has lots of potential, but under utilised. Staff weren't very friendly either, but that could be due to language barriers.,I‚Äôd struggle to pick anything, but if I was it would be the location ever so slightly, but it wasn‚Äôt too far a walk for most things.,n.a.,The location of the hotel seems to be in a younger part of Paris. Lots of night life going on, so those easily disturbed by noise may not enjoy this hotel. The receptionists are not very friendly or attentive and actually make guests feel awkward and unwelcome at times.,Nothing.,Small bedroom. Not possible to open closet doors all the way because bed blocks it.,The gym room air con wasn‚Äôt working nor two prices of the equipment- one clearly hadn‚Äôt been working for a while. The room mattress was slightly hard for me.,Nothing,Shower was broken,Not sure I was given the room that I had reserved. The check in lady, almost rude,The lobby very small not really well kept but ok
Close to hotel were bong smoking stores you could see people via storefront windows lying around with hookah, apparatus looked very sleezy,Nil,Shower in the room was poor, low pressure and didn‚Äôt sit right on stand,No,The bathtub inside the bathroom is not very safe. It is slippery and you only have a hand douche in it. You can still handle it, but for this price I was expecting an actual shower.,Room layout is very weird, the tv canno be realistically used while in bed. Shower/batch is open to the bedroom (so no door) which wasn't expected,As a 4 star , the fone didn‚Äôt work , no creams,coffee machine was a bit shaky, I didn't like the taste so much
but the one in our room was great,The door entry didn‚Äôt seem to work I was given a key ..also the shower wouldn‚Äôt stay up kept slipping down ‚Ä¶,The cocktailbar/ restaurant was closed,checkout time,The food in the main restaurant was a little disappointing.,All OK,Couldn‚Äôt work the aircon, but happily left the windows open for some fresh air. Coffee and tea would‚Äôve been nice in the room.,It‚Äôs pricey and gym is pretty small. They charge for coffee at reception, which seems stingy given the h√¥tel price.,There is no airconditioning in the room (it says so in the description on booking but it is a heating system). Sleeping with an open window is quite noisy in the rooms on the frontside of the building.,We came back from dinner and we wanted a drink before bed but could not get one,Very loud music till 1am. Worst wifi ever.,no parking facility and no advise from the hotel how to find a parking place in the area. circled around to find a parking place for over an hour. we found out that there are good garages closely, which you have to reserve upfront. Having this upfront via website or employee who I asked about this, would have been helpful.,Rooms could be a little bigger, but then this is the heart of Paris!,The bath is built for very tall people. It's hard to get in and out of it,Our safe didn‚Äôt work in the bedroom and the overall finish was poor, one light switch falling off etc,Would have liked coffee maker in room,Rigid check in. Party noise late at night . Poor view,You can‚Äôt charge your phone when you turn off the lights. So I have to keep the lights on just to wake up with my phone in full power. That‚Äôs weird.,The shower head in the room did not work properly. But thats the only thing.,On booking, I requested twin beds for my 16 year old daughter and I and we were given (thankfully a very large) double. Whilst we could manage, this wasn't ideal.
The windows onto the street aren't double glazed so, even with ear plugs in, the road noise really disturbed my light sleeping daughter and she slept quite badly.,Needs general maintenance the shower goes hot and cold this is my second stay here and it‚Äôs done it both times bathrooms need a update very worn even from my last stay which was November 2022,nothing,Breakfast is nice, but it‚Äôs the same every day and you have to pay extra for omelettes, and avocado on toast etc which is not advertised.,The reception were I‚Äôll prepared for the influx of check-ins during the rugby World Cup. Waiting time was long and the space was quite small.,I thought the music in the morning could have been more contemplative and jazzy. The music fit a happy hour experience. I always like an egg option and they wanted you to pay for it. When you had already had breakfast included in your res. I can understand paying for an omelet but maybe some boiled eggs could have been nice free of charge.,Asked to bring a dental kit and slippers, they said that there were no dental kits. but then they still brought a toothbrush. but there were no slippers in the room or upon request, but there were tiles on the floor, and it was cold to walk,Breakfast
Request hotel to arrange a driver, they were not able to do that,clean and cosy but not so stylish what we expected.,no slippers in the bedroom,The shower flooded the bathroom every time would have been nice to be able to get a drink on an evening. Thought it was overpriced compared to UK / London,Not enough big cups for coffee.,tiny room, many of the lights didnt work and couldnt find the switch for the bed side table. poor tv channel availability. no safe in the room.,The breakfast was very limited (also confirmed by other guests)
By default only 3 different cheese and 3 meat, jam and 1 type baguette, some yoghurt and 1 bowl with fresh fruit salad available. There was an option to buy eggs / bacon and some other stuff (but also there a lot was not available in that menu like salmon) It's a pity cause the breakfast room they are serving the meal in was stunning, in a nice theme...,breakfast so minimal,The reception is very small. The lift landings/lobbies are extremely cramped. They did not give us street facing rooms though we had requested. We stayed here twice (May 11-16 and May 19-22). On May 16th, when we were checking out, they confirmed they would give us street facing room on May 19th when we checked in again. But on 19th, they told us that street facing rooms was a different category. This is unfair. Also, nothing on booking.com told us that there was a different category with higher prices. This was a sore point for us.,minor things like no free coffee, not being new & polished (but still clean),I felt that the hotel did not live to our expectations. We came for 5 nights and booked 3 deluxe rooms but these were not equal. Every room had something missing that was promised in the website (a coffee machine, complimentary water, double beds etc.). The 3rd floor was noisy and the nothing was offered by the staff to resolve this. Room was not as clean as you would imagine a 4 stars hotel in Paris should be. Staff was very nice but if nothing is resolved this does not helpful. I do not see us coming back.","everything was just amazing! we had problem with the room the first night and they upgraded us for free for the rest of our stay! the breakfast was very good especially compare to Paris hotels ! the location is amazing! walking distance (5 mins and up to 40 mins) to almost everywhere! and last but not least the staff! they were so nice, helpful, carrying !

It was a bit narrow.,Nothing!!!,The breakfast was not bad, but we missed vegetables and hot dishes like scrambled eggs or omelettes.

"4 Boulevard Raspail, 7th arr., 75007 Paris, France",Miiro Le Grand H√¥tel Cayr√©,"Nothing,Nothing,I faced a few issues: the reception was sometimes unresponsive, the restaurant service closes too early, and there‚Äôs no luggage assistance available. Despite these points, it‚Äôs a nice hotel with a great atmosphere,Not enough hooks in the bathroom, room was very warm even with the heat off, even if you don‚Äôt clean we should get water restocked or offered to us upon entering. No lobby or lounge for hotel guests to spend time in is not ideal. Front desk receptionists did not recognize us upon entering. All the staff in the restaurant itself were lovely and accommodating.,Standard room was really small, the bathroom cannot fit a built person.,Nothing,Breakfast,Nothing. Perfect. Minor shower issue fixed immediately.,The location was great, but was in a quieter part of St. Germaine than I had expected.,The towels and bathrobes are brand new (that‚Äôs good!) but they were shedding a lot of fluff.

Unlike the rest of the staff, the hotel manager‚Äôs unhelpful attitude was troubling.,Nothing, it was perfect!,Rooms were a little small especially with 2 two large suitcases. We reserved a room with a city view which wasn‚Äôt really a city view just a view of the street below and building across the road. This is a little misleading.,Water not included in the price. I suggest 1-2 bottles per day is a MUST for the 5-star hotel.,Wish bed a was a little bigger but not really a complaint,I struggled using the Aero Guest app to open my room door (it worked fine in the elevator) but Enrico gave us each a plastic room key, which solved the problem. I wish there were more items on their menus, but despite that, all of the meals we had were delicious.,Limited food offering
Very limited Room Service,I liked it all,I stayed 2 nights and didn‚Äôt know that the room only get cleaned for longer stays,None,None,Non,Small rooms,The staff is not trained at all. They were able to give us the keys to the room only on the third try. The breakfast that was included in the price is useless. I do not recommend paying for breakfast in advance at this hotel. When checking in, they gave me the wrong room that I ordered, but they changed it right away. The staff is very friendly, but absolutely useless. The rooms are small, and there are rooms with windows overlooking the wall.,Very minor, not keen on frosted glass bathroom door.,Bigger croissants for breakfast would be nice.,Maybe the bathroom and rooms could be bigger .. but i guess tahts just france,Everything was perfect,Not applicable,Breakfast mediocre - no buffer available. Housekeeping could be better coordinated.,Very nice decor and vibes. Also Indian owned which means great hospitality,Nothing.,Hopefully they will offer room service soon,Nothing,I thought they would clean the rooms for that price‚Ä¶,Slightly mean, giving a basket of croissants etc with one butter for two people.,They don‚Äôt clean the rooms everyday,small table and bathroom,the bedding quality isn't great and was not breathable. I would highly recommend better sheets and comforter to match the quality of the rest of the room and hotel. That was the only negative.,the reception were both slow to check in, and one of the female receptionists forgot my room number and delayed iron and iron board therefore made me late for a meeting as i needed to press my shirt after travelling with it in my case,they did not consider the ventilation. The rooms and hotel itself smells like food. The staff is not interested at all. They di not have vales and welcomlng staff.,During room cleaning, they did not bring water for 3 days, and they didn‚Äôt replenish the tissues or water in the room. It‚Äôs unfortunate that such a nice hotel lacks proper service.,The restroom is too small. The restaurant service staff is overall friendly except for one shift manager who is less friendly with attitude.","Excellent location. Walkable to so many places.

Anyway, we didn‚Äôt spend too many time in our room.,Excellent, new hotel in the city center.
If you like new, well-designed hotels, then this is the option for you. Excellent bed, towels. Excellent cosmetics in the bathroom. For Parisian hotels, this is a level above the rest. The size of the room, as everywhere, is modest, but this is perhaps a local feature of all hotels. You can spend a little more money and get a larger room.

It's walking distance to Musee D'Orsay and other attractions. Another nice thing is that it wasn't in a touristy area. There was a market close by. The room was quiet and well appointed. The interior of the hotel is very updated and clean. This was probably one of the nicest hotels we stayed in throughout our trip.,Great location in the centre of the 7th arrondissement.

I hope they can keep this standard up for this relatively good price.,The hotel was a bit old for infrastructure, for example the elevator is quite small, the corridor is also very narrow and comes with stairs sometimes which makes it difficult to walk with big luggage.

There is nothing I can think off.,The sink was blocked, but they did fix it once reported so I can‚Äôt complain too much. If your room is on the side of the street view it is noisy, so if you‚Äôre sensitive to sounds it might be an issue so maybe a room on the other side is better. Also, the smoke from the smokers downstairs waft into the room.,Room was small but that is to be expected in Paris.,1 Room TV has no English channels.

It was located in a good spot but without a lot of noise which was a huge plus! The beds were so comfortable and we loved the waterfall shower! There is also AC here which is a rarity but we ended up not using it stall because it was chilly in Paris during our stay. We also used the gray curtains to block out sunlight from the windows.

"26 rue des gravilliers, 3rd arr., 75003 Paris, France",Les Patios du Marais 1,"Too small,The chairs were very uncomfortable 
We were on the 3rd floor - it was difficult to get our suitcase up,The studio is way too small. Wi-Fi was quite slow and no lift.,I felt some of the furnishings were a little tired (ie the dining chairs, and headboard cushions).,the noise level, the lack of AC (it was very hot that day), the mezzanine had open shelves where my toddler would fully fit and fall through if we didn't check,A bit more cleaning wouldn‚Äôt hurt,The only thing I didn't like was the lack of soundproofing as I could hear everyone on tbe stairs and fron the next rooms.,Slight difficulty with carrying items up and down the stairs - luckily I had help. There are ground floor rooms available for those with mobility issues.,When I first visited this property in 2023, they had an office out front. For my visit in 2024 the office was closed, you had to do an echeck in, and nobody could be found. It was really bizarre, there was nobody to talk to, no office, no details in the emails of where to find someone (besides a phone number that nobody answered). I ran into other people at the complex who were also confused why nobody could be found. Finally we happened to run into someone and he helped us get more towels, but it would have been nice to just walk into an office and speak to someone when we need something. So I‚Äôm not sure why they closed the office. The rooms are also very small, especially the bathroom and shower.,It smelled a bit of pipes, every time we got home we had to open the windows to get rid of the smell.,The fact that there‚Äôs no reception/anybody to interact with if you have questions about checking in,Stairs to the 5th floor!,The low seeling!,Be prepared for the stairs, didn‚Äôt affect us but may to some.,n/a,The sofa in our rom was dirty.,Two flights up, winding and steep stairs. Very difficult with luggage.
Shower was very tight and difficult to regulate the temperature.,The shower room extractor fan couldn't be turned off and the electricity kept phasing out,Small room for the price, but understandable due to it being Paris. Would have liked for the bathroom to have a fan or ventilation as it got very muggy,Only bed with easy access overnight to toilet was sofa bed.,Room was much smaller than photos seemed. Not a lot of space to move around or keep bags in the room. Would need to be very close with those staying in the room as no privacy within the room. The top bed is only suitable for shorter people as it was very tight for space.,Everything was ok,Tiny. Family of 4 in one room, using sofa bed, no room to move at all,only main bed was made up no welcoming milk or attention to smaller details,on confirmation email didn‚Äôt give us a room number so we had the code and the floor number just not what room.,the stairs!,Not enough hanging space for clothes,It has very small bathrooms/showers and the website advertised washing machines in rooms and there was not.,washrooms are small and a tight fit.,The lady at the front desk didn‚Äôt really want to help much and ignored me when I was asking her questions.

And trying to get a warm water balance is hard. It‚Äôs either super hot or cold,Not an amazing shower,The bathroom was dated and cracks in tiles.. 4th gloor no lift was not told.,No available check-in or luggage storage at property before 3 pm check-in, difficult if don‚Äôt know area.,Not really a dislike for me, but worth noting for others. The beds are right up in the roof and as such, you can't stand up fully while next to them. There are plants over the windows which gives you lots of privacy but it does make the room really dark. Our room is at the top of a very old building and as such the stairs are narrow and will make taking a big suitcase up tricky.,I didn't get the room I booked, and I was not informed of the reason why. I booked D1DD but was given D1GD. Each room has different furnishings so the host ought to let me know if they could not give me the room I booked. The shower is also extremely tight.,The apartment is advertised for up to four people. Both rooms were very small In fact it looked like one room had been divided to make a small bedroom Bed took all the space Lounge area with converted sofa only room for two people to sit down no dining area Kitchen only allowed for one person at a time. Main entrance to the flat was very dirty and needed a good clean. Disappointing because flat was very clean.,Apartment was tiny and the windows were overgrown with vegetation so couldn't look out into the pretty courtyard,The room is very small. The shower is hard to get in (there's a toilet in front of the shower). Would not recommended for older people.,In this day and age there is no excuse for bad wifi . This was a working holiday and I had to hotspot to get online. They really need to sort this out. Also the walls are paper thin so you can hear everything.,It would be good to have a little extra cutlery or dishes. The hot water in the shower was a bit variable.,No serious problems. Other guests noisy in the passageway.,Cot was too long. Friend cut herself on sharp edge sticking into room.

It was clean and comfortable.,All information needed for check in was supplied in advance of the visit. Finding the building was a little difficult - however - that was due to location of where driver stopped. I had friends meeting me there, and as such can‚Äôt give accurate review of access to building.
I absolutely loved the view of the garden from my room, filling the room with refreshing fragrance from the flowers outside the windows.
All required self catering amenities at hand, plenty of little shops and restaurants close by, and wonderful interactions with friendly locals.

Breakfast is poor.,Too small and too many rooms in one floor cause difficulty in getting lift.,The clothes bar in the room is quite limited and the bed might not be the perfect to sleep.

It was difficult to even wash face due to its tiny size bay.,The bathroom wasn‚Äôt small and there was no bath mat.,The bed was a little uncomfortable.

And one lift stop working on the checkout day.,The room we got oversees a cemetery. Maybe it‚Äôs fine for some people, but for our culture, it‚Äôs not that preferable. We would try to avoid that.
Also, a lady with glasses at the reception isn‚Äôt very friendly or polite.,The community bathroom had an extremely bad smell and we didn‚Äôt have any wardrobes in our room. Sometimes it was very loud at night. We only had time for breakfast until 9:30 a.m., which is too short in my opinion,Dirty Bathrooms,Very very small bathroom :/,Feels isolated, especially at night,Uncomfortable bed and pillows.,We chose a tandem room, without WC and shower so we had to use the shared WC and showers. Sometimes, the WC were dirty... but it's entirely the other clients' fault, since the staff really clean everything many times a day.
Metro station was not very close.

But it‚Äôs ok because several busses and trains nearby,Bathroom was really small. I‚Äôm 1.87m and they should not have added the toilet next to the shower and sink. Or make a toilet in the other room. Instead of the second door to go out. Thats a big space for improvement. They could easily make the bathroom twice as big if they remove door to go outside. Breakfast is also rather easy add some eggs with bacon and it improved allot,Everything is okay but the sink in the bathroom is a bit small so it was a bit comfortable to use,showers and sanitary installations were a bit dirty sometimes, depending on the times (before breakfast etc.),Location is a little bit far from the centre of Paris.

They don't offer soap and shampoo.,It was quite far from the station- but we learned to use the tram on the second day!,Property should provide at least cutlery ...,Needs more pillows,I found the reception staff extremely unfriendly and rude. During check-in, nothing was told to us regarding facilities. We thought the person was just having a bad day. But we stayed there 3 nights and even our greetings would be ignored. It wasn't only one staff, it was all the receptionists. 
During checkout, I was going to hand the card and the guy just pointed at a box and said nothing. Not even a ""have a nice day"". It felt like they were doing a favor to you. I am not expecting 5-star treatment, but being polite doesn't hurt.,Quite noisy during the night and the room was quite warm","It's clean!

"73 Rue Saint-Jacques, 5th arr., 75005 Paris, France",Hotel Diana Paris,"The rooms a little stark in appearance.,Sink was cracked probably due to a busy summer of Olympics.,The property is in an old section of the city and is a 2 star property so keep that in mind in terms of what you expect. Rooms are smaller than you would find in some larger hotel chains, and some of the furnishings in the room were a bit more run down than we expected, for example, the headboard was noticeably peeling, and we had difficulties getting the safe to work and the staff member who tried to help us was also unable to fix it. We did get a good price for the hotel room in this area of the city though so I felt that the value for money was reasonable.,Nothing, all suited our needs,My room was quite small, but it was a single room, so that makes sense.,Room was small,More toiletries such as shampoo and conditioner would be great.,Very compact property, not sure whether it is equipped to deal with emergencies like fire outbreak ?,I would recommend booking directly through the hotel. 
I think booking.com charged much more than if I‚Äôd just contacted hotel directly. There was also a problem with a scam email from booking.com that said I needed to ‚Äòenter credit card again to confirm‚Äô‚Ä¶weeks after I‚Äôd paid & confirmed. I did not‚Ä¶& contacted the hotel directly & they said that my stay was paid/confirmed & that it was indeed a scam request. Just be careful online. (That‚Äôs why I recommend direct hotel contact.),N/A,The room was very small, with a very skinny bathtub/shower that had virtually no pressure. Quite difficult to get in and out of. The curtains were missing some hooks and hanging lopsided. This might sound finicky but it just looked bad and sometimes small details like this are important.,Rooms can be quite small, but you won‚Äôt spend there much time anyway, thus, it wasn‚Äôt a factor for us.,NOTHING,First night room - 44 with spiral staircase.

The sink was not functioning properly, it would not drain,The room was very small, which is standard for Paris, however it was smaller than what I had expected from the photos.

We were there for the Olympics so paid a high premium price,The room did not have a street view.,I had requested a room with a street view days before my arrival. Not a big deal, but would have been nice if a polite request coud have been honoured.,Standard of decor: Peeling paint on the walls and skirting-boards, peeling headboard, no toilet roll (had to ask three times to get some!) and coloured mould around the bath/shower.

Bathroom has a low ceiling so if you 1.80 it will be a challenge to take a shower)),nothing,The bed for two was a bit narrow (so one of us even felt down once). Plus, the toile door needed some heavy oiling, but the personnel said they have no-one to help, unfortunately. And we ran out toilet paper and it took time to find the spare stock :D,The room is really small. At last 2 days there was no heeting.
The fixator of shower is missing- you have to hold it all the time,The rooms need some serious upgrading on sound proof. Street noise is always expected but that was not the noise issue. We could hear everything from the neighbouring room. We were surprised how much we could hear.,Bad sound isolation, small room,Room and bathroom are very small with low and irregular ceiling shapes.,The beds weren't the comfiest, but nothing terrible and for the price it was more than pleasant enough.,the cleaners need to be more hardworking. There was one time, my room was unlocked when I get back from my city visit.
the empty bottles were not cleared for days and I had to throw it myself.,The hall and breakfast rooms were bandly sedisgned and felt vert dated.not in a good way. Sort og 2,. grade IKEA feeling, No indication of anything organic and what were we eating I dont know.,It is a bit overpriced.,Some things in the room were not very clean, and the big soap bottles in the bathroom were both empty.,The room safe was broken. We would have used it for security whilst we were out at night.
The shower head had to be held at all times. Broken fixing

It was also a short walk from the major train stations for travel by train or Metro to airports, to Versaille, and to sites around the city like the Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triumph. Location is why we selected this property and it met all expectations. The breakfast was included in our stay and we enjoyed a French style breakfast each day with fresh croissants, yogurts, eggs, cheeses, meats, toast, and fruit as well as coffee, hot chocolate or tea.

It was good value for its location, and our room was very quiet (though probably because it faced an internal atrium and had no street view). The staff were friendly and helpful.,It was in a good location, with plenty of cafes/bistros, a mini market and the metro. It had a lift and was clean and tidy and had everything we expected.

No bin bags for dust bins.,Room is really small for a couple: no space to leave the bags opened and the bathroom is really small.,Loud street but it‚Äôs not fault of the hotel,The parking is indeed a bit of a hassle (well, that's Paris). The hotel's own garage is filled up fast, so if you book later, you can only use the Indigo parking nearby at a reduced rate for your stay (2pm to noon) - it's a few mins walk so not far, but there's no designated load off / on area in front of the hotel, so either you stop where it's not permitted, or you walk with all your stuff from the Indigo. With a baby, while raining, it's not pleasant I can tell, if you travel light, it's ok. (They would really only need a drop off spot by the hotel to solve this issue.)
And yes, a handtowel would be ""handy"" (other comments mentioned it also) but honestly for a few nights, it doesn't matter and is for sure more sustainable üòâ,Breakfast could have been a little bit better and please be aware while booking this place, it is very nice but far from metro and train stations; about a 20 minute walk to both and a while into city center.,bit far from center of Paris,Towels were a bit small.,The breakfast had few options if you are used to have a good breakfast. No vegetable at all. 
Even though it was September when we had our stay, in the room was really cold and we do not have the possibility to have heat in the room because it was considered it is not winter time and the heat was not turn on in the hotel. I think the hotel should take in consideration the current weather and temperature in the room because it was cold and my friend catch a cold because of that.
It would be appreciated a smart tv in the room to have access to the streaming apps.,The breakfast is terrible. Don‚Äôt add breakfast. Rather eat out.,There was no closet or cupboard in the hotel room,Slightly small bedroom,Hot water consistency from the shower can be better,Our sink plug got stuck so the sink was blocked the whole time, location is in a bad place, area is quite dodgy and there's a strip of homeless people around the corner, didn't feel safe at night with the creepy men,There were not enough towels in the bathroom, so we had to go to the reception every day to ask for extra ones. Two people were given only one towel per day. When booking the hotel, it was unclear if they had parking space, its cost, and how to reserve it. Upon arrival, we discovered that the hotel parking place was full, but they offered us an option for an underground parking a bit further away that cost over 20Eur / day. The parking was safe and close to public transport, though.,Firstly. The resturant menu is very very limited., as for the cleaning it's very clean , the house keeping staff were helpful though they don't understand me .,You don't really get anything, just the minimum that you can expect with your room. Liquid soap, hairdryer, (only) 1 towel for each person plus one as a mat for the shower. Don't expect any amenities or appliances. Very little space to put your clothes to. You get a smaller variety for breakfast than other chains, but surprisingly it's enough. All in all, it's just a budget hotel.,It was basic for the price and no bar on a Sunday night .,Nothing,T‚Äôas,Rooms are small. Somethings are not working and should be fixed (coffee machine, tv),It¬¥s far way froom city centre, we had to take the Metro with is near hotel but the journey is about 30 minutes,No tea/coffee in rooms. Small towels.,The area around the hotel is not the most glamorous, hence the lower cost of the hotel rooms. But it‚Äôs a short walking distance to the metro station.,The location is difficult, there are no food options at night, only delivery, no utensils to eat in the room.,The fact that the hotel provided only one towel in the room,Everything. Good place to travel and enjoy your time staying there.,The location was not the best. However, if it had been better, the price would have been much higher, so i‚Äôm happy!,Size of room,The WiFi didn‚Äôt work. The rooms were VERY basic.,.,Scary building opposite the hotel, but it's not a problem, because I was staying for just one night.,We didn't like the location of this hotel. Although the public transport is good in Paris but next time I would prefer to stay near the metro station. This is 20 mins bus right from the nearest metro station and if you are returning late at night from the Paris City Centre, the buses are unpredictable.,They had only 2 towels for 2 people, no hand towel, no towel for your head/hair.
they only had 3 hangers in the room and no iron or ironing board,When I was there the bar was closed.,location, little bit far,Not applicable,While the hotel is within walking distance from a metro station, the walk did not feel very safe during nighttime.,Nothing,- Room was small for 2 persons,
But really it is good for a sleep

- No coffee machine in the room, although some same rooms have coffee machine in the same property,Not much space for luggage,A bit noise at night, could hear when somebody open their doors at night.,on arrival the taxi didn't know where to park as the entrance was confusing . This made the driver confused and he turned around back unto the road for another 10 minutes.,Though the location is close to a metro station and I didn‚Äôt feel as unsafe as some YouTube reviews show for the neighbourhood, as a solo female traveller I definitely had to take an Uber back since it was quite far.,There was no water kettle in the room. I keep on asking assistance from the staff but nobody bothers.,No electric kettle, no flat iron.,None,A little bit cold ü•∂,There were no lock in the bathroom,The staff was a bit off (doing their job with a strange grimace), location in a doubtful neighborhood.,The pictures showed a Coffee machine for the room but it wasn't there in the room.,The personnel who was there the moment we check in. We look a place or accommodation with parking but he gave us an access on the parking next morning. He said it needs a reservation but it was not stated on the site that we have to do it in advance.,No refrigerator in the rooms,no baby cot,rooms are small but good for few days,Parking . üòû Had to carry our bags and go to another private parking . It was just few meters away. But was hectic . And charging from
Customers for 17 euros seperatly doesnt feel good.,A bit far from the city center, but as I said, close to a metro station.","Staff service and cleanliness is excellent,Great,It‚Äôs very affordable for the price and the stuff is really good. The rooms are actually comfortable . Not quite a variety for breakfast.,We were looking for a place for one night and this place met our requirements. The bed and room was cleaned, comfortable. Breakfast very tasty (eggs, bacon, yoghurts, baked things, excellent orange juice).

Yes, room and bathroom are tiny, (that's Parisian standard) but it was ok to fit 2 of us and even the travel bed and stroller of our baby.
Buses and metro to city center are 5 mins walk, and depending on where you go, center is within 20-30 mins reach.
There's also a little bar, microwave and snack machine in the lobby - and tea& coffee in the room. (no fridge or water kettle though). The evening shift at the reception was welcoming (we arrived late).,Bed were super comfy and staff was quite pleasant,Cleaning, good personal, very nice restaurant.,The hotel was somewhat basic, but was spacious and clean, with good facilites. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good, and although there was no restaurant, there was a nice bar and an automated takeway service which could be delivered to your room.,The hotel was close to a metro station (5 mins walk) or bus station in the back of the hotel. You also can go to the groceries store in 5 mins walk because it is close to the hotel.
The bed mattress was excellent and we rest really well. The room was clean.
The breakfast coffee was ok.

The hotel had a bar in the lobby where you can have a late drink.

The staff is amazing for example Oceana,Julian , Rio,and the black slim reception man ,the Black lady with thick lips . All of them were helpful even the barman. The location is abit far from the city center,A reasonally priced hotel, quite typical, like other budget hotel chains. Relatively close to underground station. A few minutes' walk from shops, restaurants that stay open late. Beds are a bit small (the width), but very comfortable. Breakfast is good, you can have scrambled eggs, bacon, baguette, croissant, some other types of bread, pain au chocolat, some spreads: jams, hazelnut spread, caramel. There are also some types of yoghurt, butter, a fruit salad, maybe a bit more. No veggies. Some vending machines on the ground floor, plus microwave oven, some places to relax.,We got a good deal but wouldn‚Äôt pay the actual price as lacks services .,Staff were friendly, Breakfast was good value, Room/ensuite was clean, Bed was very comfortable, Metro line is very close, and area around hotel is okay.

"28 allee Rose Dieng Kuntz , 19th arr., 75019 Paris, France",UCPA SPORT STATION HOSTEL PARIS,"Just as a suggestion I would like to say about power outlets besides the beds. I mean, they have usb entries, but mine is USB-c so it was a bit annoying going to other place with power outlets to charge my phone. But just this small thing,Maybe unclear about missing kitchen. Just expected it to have one like most hostels.,The only thing would be the some of showers had a bit of mold but that was it.,The bathroom was a little bit old.,there aren't any power plug sockets near beds for usb c only the normal usb end (so if you have a newer phone you can't charge it, only one normal plug in the room, saw many people charge their phones in the hallway), you have to make your own bed, and the eco friendly powder soap in the toilets is not my favorite,- the linen was clean but some had mold marks - perhaps it could be possible to do something about it
- some barista were not very nice (a guy (the one that is less high than others:) and a girl with long hair) but nothing too crucial
- maybe the area is not perfect in terms of safety, but it worked fine for me, although I avoided walking in late evening 
- I missed some place to get the work done that works 24h or kitchen - they close downstairs cafe after 11, there is still some small place to work on the 1st floor but Wi-Fi doesn‚Äôt work there well and there are no plugs for laptop.

Other than that it felt good value for money, I don‚Äôt regret.,You should extend the checkout time.,There wasn't a regular plug socket as advertised, not that I needed it.
The room door was impossible to open and close quietly.,It was quite far out (recommend 7 metro line from Crimee),Lack of common kitchen,Not the most comfortable sleeping situation and not much going on right around the hostel.,- no kitchen 
- bus to Nord station can be crowded and delayed by heavy traffic,We were a little bit hot in the room (8th floor).,The entrance localization is soo confuse. It was around 2am, I was alone and I could not find the reception door... It was not acording to the Google Maps as well. Lucky, I couple who live in the hotel passed me and helped me find reception and call the receptionist. We pressed the button three times and the receptionist wasn't coming. But even for this couple who live there, it was confusing to find reception. I was very lucky to have been helped, otherwise I don't know how many more minutes I would have spent on the street, vulnerable and tired, until I found reception and was able to get into the hotel. 

Then, at reception, I asked for a bath towel and some soap. But the receptionist couldn't find any soap. This was the first hostel I'd ever been to where there was no soap (you don't have to offer for free, but at least have some for sale...). I can say that my shower that day was one of the strangest and most unhygienic experiences I've ever had...,There wasn‚Äôt a guest kitchen. There is a restaurant. They allowed me to use their microwave a few times but later said they couldn‚Äôt do that anymore.
The dryers steal your money. 2 euros to start and if you open the door and then try to resume drying it will cost another 2 euros.,No basket court,The breakfast was a little underwhelming but it does the job. The location is convenient next to the train station, but can be a bit scary at night for a solo woman traveller.,None,The mattresses and bed linen are rather hot, also in the rooms there is no air conditioning,Paying for towels :(,it was expensive for a hostel but I guess that was because of the Olympics,Location was in a more rogue suburb,Nothing not to like this hostel is very good value for money.,I didn't like the lack of sockets to recharge the electronics equipment. The bedroom where I stayed, there were only 2 sockets and in my bed only 1. I didn't like the noise, for example, the mattress and the door are extremely noisy.,No complaints!,Location was a bit far out.,The info that we can reach the reception 24/7 was wrong, accordƒ±ng to my personal experience. I was sleepy while going to the toilet at night, and I forgot the door card in the room. But I took my phone. When I returned, I realized that I would not be able to enter the room, so I wanted to reach the reception. The door between the reception and the rooms was locked. I knocked repeatedly. No one heard. Then I called the reception number and the phone was not answered. I spent 15 minutes there. I came to the door of the room again to desperately knock on the door. When I pushed the door, by chance, the door opened! I guess it wasn't locked properly behind me. Then I learned that only a security guard walking around at night.
I thought it was risky and strange to have that door locked on all guests when there was a mid level emergency. 
Also, there are no sockets near the bed or in the room. There is a USB port near your bed. However, there is no USB-C port, you have to go down to the common area and wait for the multiple socket there to charge your iPhone. And if I knew I wouldn't pay breakfast for corny croissants and the poorest quality machine coffee. I didn't mention that it was noisy because it's not the facility's fault. but be aware that it is noisy.,How far it was from the down town,Closing of front, common area during the night,Pillow were not too confortable. I also suggest having AC in rooms in summer,All fine just that never stayed in q hostel thus,No water fountain‚Ä¶ you can ask for them to fill up your bottle behind the bar yet we‚Äôd come back after 11 and have no water, but not a major issue. We also had a problem with our keycards for the rooms. The man at reception was not very polite about it yet the woman was lovely.,Breakfast was very ordinary and way overpriced. I'd expect eggs for that price.,Showers are tight to manoeuvre in. 
The power points in the room did not work. Only 2 of the 6usb plugs worked.,Mattresses on the beds were gym mats so not the most comfortable. Staff were a bit stand-offish but everything was easy enough.,The location is far from the center, but it was ok.,Nothing to dislike,Does get rather hot in the rooms and no way to prevent this. Showers got a little musky but were cleaned daily.,They don‚Äôt have enough outlets to charge everyone‚Äôs phone :( and the soap at the bathroom could be changed to liquid soap‚Ä¶ that was a weird way to save money tbh haha,Breakfast options were very limited. Too few sockets were offered in the room and this made it hard to charge items. Main door was closed during the night, and wayfinding of the entrance was not that easy,A bit of a walk to the metro in an area that isn't the best but for the money can't complain.,Breakfast was a bit simple, though sufficient. Low number of bathrooms and showers for the number of available beds per floor. Location was 50/50, nice and modern towards Rose Parks, looking more derelict and worn down towards the west.
Bunk itself was also a bit of a tight squeeze, making your bed is definitely harder in the top bunk!,The bathroom was smelling a little musky but the room was quite clean.,Beds were very uncomfortable. There was no fridges in the unit or in a shared space or provided anywhere. Decent location, not too far from the subway but bit of a strange area. Towels cost 3 euros.,Nothing,Had a private room, asked to sweep the floor once throughout our 4 night stay but unable to do.,We could hear the tram from our room, especially since our window was open as it was hot. It's not the loudest but if you're a light sleeper, you may want to bring some ear plugs. The only other tiny thing I didn't like was that we didn't have enough electrical plugs in the room. Again, not the biggest thing.,The common area is pretty noisy,the bathroom could have been in the room but it was fine.,The guy with an Afro hair. Was so rude ‚Ä¶ also the location is kinda far from everything ‚Ä¶ and they charged me 5 euros to keep my luggage. But not at the storage room ‚Ä¶he just hide it behind the counter ‚Ä¶ poor service,The location is a bit too far from city centre.,Extract system was not working when showering.,Snoring room mates,There‚Äôs no type c charger for the phone over the bed only usb,Although the location is close to metro line and bus stations, it is far away from center.","The location, the staff, the room itself and the cleanness,The staff were lovely, friendly and happy to help. The bedroom/ board room where I stayed was comfortable and the curtain around the bunk was a bliss when I needed privacy. Prices were great, and location to the station was also good.,It was clean and tidy. And the staff was very friendly and helpful.,Staff's attitude,I stayed in a 6 bed-room. It had curtains for the beds that are located down level which gave me comfort and privacy.,curtains around the beds are great, it's like you have your little private area in the room,I liked that it‚Äôs located at the sport center - so there are always a lot of people doing sports which created nice atmosphere, the place felt cheerful and alive.

The hostel was okay value for money, the location felt comfortable but I tried not to walk late in the evening - around 21:30-22 pm it already didn‚Äôt feel very nice to walk from metro to the hotel.

Night staff were nice and helpful 

I liked the food at the cafe, coffee not so much.
Not all the barista were nice to communicate, but two of them were just amazing!

And they have flowers that got names:) 
Place with soul for sure.,The reception was extra ordinary. 
Thank you so much.,It was a my first stay at a hostel and was pleasantly surprised. I had the bottom bunk which had room around it. I never had to wait to use the toilet or shower.,Bottom bunks were the best! Have a pull around curtains so makes it like it‚Äôs own little room. Upper bunks less fortunate though. I think I was the only girl on my floor for a couple days too which was great for the showers/toilets üòÖ,Probably the best hostel in Paris. Felt completely safe. Giant beds with high privacy. Very clean washrooms and facilities. Absolutely lovely hostel.,Location, sports activities offered by the hostel,GREAT hostel rather big but has lots of facilities very close to public transport going straight into town,Staff were friendly which was nice. Location is ok, one or two stops on the train and you‚Äôre in the thick of it. Walk about 5-10mins from the hostel towards the canal and things liven up a bit.,I really appreciated big personal spaces in the dorm room - the curtain goes actually around your bed, and leaves plenty of private space, that was pretty cool! 

Overall, I had a nice stay,+ staff is helpful and friendly (easy checkin/out & with filling up tap water)
+ close to supermarket 
+ spacy single bed with curtain / wardrobe,The facilities are fantastic (climbing wall, tennis courts, squash courts etc etc). 
The location is great.
The caf√© is great.
Nice big windows in the room...,very clean and confortable.,An amazing concept. As a guest you have complete access to all the sport facilities.,Almost everything,Simple,The room was very spacious and clean, and it even had a view! It's super cool that the sports amenities are free for the hostel guests too!,Location it‚Äôs close to train station,Was very clean, has everything you need,The place is new, clean and very organized. Staff is nice and everything went very well. It‚Äôs a bit far from touristic places, but there‚Äôs public transportation very near to the hostel.,great hostel. good value breakfast. great sports facilities,the facilities were very nice and clean, watched the euro cup at the bar downstairs and all very nice and so far one of the best hostels ive stayed in. also they offered breakfast (personally didnt attend so cant really comment),Clean property with new refreshed look and feel,Room was clean and very convenient to public transport into Paris,Friendly staffs and everything is super clean/comfy, budget friendly and will come back next time if i have a chance to visit paris again,I liked it the location. It's near the train station and metro, this is very good.,This is a really cool eco-hostel! I had a very unfortunate travel experience that resulted in me reaching the hostel 14 hours later than I was supposed to and very close to midnight. The hostel was happy to accommodate me and I cannot thank them enough for that. Friendly staff, spacious dorms good location and a really great social concept. I would definitely stay here again!,Facilities were great! Very clean and big windows to keep cooler too. Still a tad hot tho. Overall great.,New, modern place. At the room privacy was OK on my bed due to wooden curtains. Fitness and climbing opportunity was nice.,The staff and the place,Liked late (after hours) check-in by very helpful staff/security person.,I like the modern design, the cleanliness and the friendliness of staff.
 I would especially like to thank Pierre for his excellent service, he always helped regarding any questions I had even when looking for a shop to buy gift from at the last minute! What a save.

Thank you Pierre for a fabulous service!!

Taxis/ubers can enter the road leading to the hotel, despite signage communicating otherwise.
The hotel would benefit from having a restaurant onsite for dinner.,I‚Äôd just prefer a little tighter shower door so the water is not leaking on a floor,The location is a bit far from the scenic spots but that applies to all in 15.,There wasn‚Äôt a lot we didn‚Äôt like. The new outdoor terrace area is lovely but because of the decking and trees there are quite a few mosquitoes and I got several bites within 2-3 mins of sitting down ! Maybe could do with some anti mosquito candles or something out there to deter them.
Some of the other guests (particularly Russians) quite rude to staff and other guests. Talking loudly on their phones in communal areas etc.,The only issue I had was with my upgraded bedroom, however the staff did everything to help me, and I got a full refund for the upgrade.

The issue was only resolved the next day, but it didn't cause us any inconvenience.,Hard to find power sockets in a room
Towels could be better,The floors were always wet because of how the overhead shower was positioned but there were towels provided for that. They forgot to leave us bedroom slippers and face towels on our first night.,No complaints!,Nothing.,The only small issue we had was that the air never worked in our room and we did open the windows to cool down, however we couldn‚Äôt leave them open while we slept as we had mosquitoes that came in.,I wished I had the chance to enjoy the breakfast, but it was not in my budget.

In the other hand shelving was adequate.,No it‚Äôs perfect :),Room 16 felt lighting was limited especially in the cupboard area where the kettle and coffee/tea items were located. Also the kettle lid did not close properly. TV cromecast was fantastic idea but the connection kept breaking down and was difficult to reset, even by hotel staff.,No door on the shower. Standard King Room was a little tight on space but it did the job.,It would not hurt to update the renovation, as the walls show signs of wear and tear.

"37 Boulevard Rochechouart, 9th arr., 75009 Paris, France",Le Regent Montmartre by Hiphophostels,"nothing really - maybe the room could do with some more decoration,1)The check in is too late, it starts at 15 /3pm
The hotel requires you to freeze ‚Ç¨100 from your bank account as deposit, but on Booking.com they haven‚Äôt stated this. Be aware, they will give your money back once you empty your room and nothing has been stolen or broken.
2)It doesn‚Äôt have a wardrobe to put your clothes on
3)They don‚Äôt let you UberEat your order to the hotel, so you have to change pick-up location,My room had 4 beds and only one outlet to plug in our electronics for the whole room.,Id prefer a better located plug near my bed,Everything..........................,It‚Äôs on the slightly pricier side so it would be nice if a few small things were provided e.g hand soap in the bathroom and a towel,Front of hotel was misleading- it looks rough from outside,The room only had two electrical outlets, for 4people,The loud steers. One of the rooms didn't have a door,Tiny bathroom,I stayed only one night. I don't have any complaints, just that the towel wasn't in my bed with the linens.,The only down side is the bathroom situation. You have 6 people sharing the same toilet in some rooms. I guess communal toilets can be better option but I don‚Äôt think they are gonna destroy to whole building and rebuild it üòÉ but it is still manageable. Putting any handwashing or soap can be great addition to the toilets.,The lift is too small, and there is a little roof leakage during a heavy rain,Thin walls (could hear water pressure and flow sounds from neighbouring bathroom).,Room was little bit small but nice,There was no soap and no socket close to bed,There were no soap provided in the room,Nothing - all good,The space in the room is really small , i was in dormitory of 4 person we were 3 person in the room and while others were in the room there was no space but it‚Äôs still fine the most important what I didn‚Äôt like was that the cleaning lady was super rude, during the breakfast there was no plates and i kindly asked about plates and she was really angry and finally i ate my breakfast on the paper instead of plate and also during the day I wanted to use bathroom which is on the first floor and she yelled at me because she was cleaning and I didn‚Äôt know it. Anyway it was super rude and even if the reception staff was really kind and sweet this lady ruined my experience in the hostel.,Check in and checkout timing,Breakfast could start half an hour earlier at 07:00.,Not necessarily an issue, but this is a fairly quiet small hostel, so might be a consideration if you‚Äôre looking for a very social or buzzy hostel.,Breakfast 
It could be improved,There was no handsoap inside the room. And maybe paper-slippers would be nice.,The breakfeast time could be until 11:00.,A little bit cold when sleeping during the night.,The outlets in my room were not working. My roommate and I had to use the outlets in the other room to charge our phones.,Staff were helpful but not overly courteous. Lift to higher floors was not adequate, wait time of over 5 minutes multiple times.,The heater was always on and it was very hot,Breakfast was embarrassing, few plain croissants, bread and jam; it not worth, do not add it. 
Staff doesn't take you into account, they even don‚Äôt greet. The hairdryer in the room didn‚Äôt work and they told me ‚Äúsorry, we do not have another one‚Äù , with 3 degrees outside it was a problem, check everything before.,breakfast should provide more options, for eg. fruits, but overall good,There could have been more provided for breakfast. Perhaps a toaster would have been useful. There was only croissants, baguettes and some cheese.,Our room was on the top floor and it got too hot and there was no way to turn off the radiator. There was a fan in the room though so we just kept that on the whole time. I also don't think the breakfast is worth it.,- i wish there were hand sanitizer dispensers in the common toilets, as the only sinks were in the room (meaning you touch door knobs with your poo hands lol),The noise insulation between rooms isn't great,Everything met my expectations, however there were not a lot of plug points throughout the room.,The hostel is located in a busy avenue, so it can be a bit noisy at night. When we were there, the weather was pleasant, so not having A/C was not a problem for us, but it could be on warmer days.,The location was a little questionable. Walking outside the hostel felt a little unsafe because of this. Although the hotel is technically in the 9th arr which has been rated as being a great location to stay, it is right on the edge of it (literally), all you need to do is cross the road and you are in the 18th arr which has been rated as being ‚Äòunsafe‚Äô. The hotel itself felt safe inside but just be aware of this if you are planning on staying, especially if you are a solo or a female traveler.,Small room to be expected in Europe - perfect size for one person,Location a bit risky,‚Ä¢ no air-conditioner in the room
‚Ä¢ the quality of breakfast is not worth 7‚Ç¨,Absolutely I didn't like Mousse employees's behaviour and his talking. He is so cold and so rud. Theodore was so cold and had not friendly. This both employees absolutely have to learning to meet someone coming to stay the hostel.,It does not have an air conditioner, the small room with 4 people, was so hot,There were constructionworks right next to our private room. We couldn‚Äôt open a window or the workers could see inside. They also started working early in the morning hitting our walls and making a lot of noise. It would have been nice if they would have mentioned it when we checked in and provided earplugs. The breakfast was very basic (only cheese and jam). There wasn‚Äôt any airconditioning and the room was very hot (underneath the rooftop), the staff provided us of 2 tiny fans, they weren‚Äôt working properly but it was very nice of them to offer. :),all good,uncomfortable beds,Lack of toilets! No toilets on level 3 where i was staying so i either had to go to level 4 (tiny tiny toilet) or down to the lobby.,Washroom facilities need to be improved,Unfortunately I need to share the room with 3 other girls and they always came back super late while I was already sleeping and the toilet didn't have a good ventilation or window so the hot air after showering didn't go away, so it was stuffy. In the morning waking up to early will disturb the others. So there wasn't any privacy and there was a bathroom waiting time so everything need to be shared. Also charging the phone or any electronic is a hussle because there was a first come first serve policy. Minus the small details over all really good. So keep those things in mind before booking.,Breakfast, same food every day and offer was pretty tiny,I wish it was possible to do the check in earlier because I arrived super early but unfortunately it was only possible from 3pm. I was allowed to leave my bag though.,I would improve the chargers situation in the rooms.,The breakfast is not a good deal - flat croissants, dry baguettes, and machine coffee. A better deal can be found out on the streets.,There are no number of beds - so it was confusing,nothing,bathroom too small.,unable to check in earlier","the excellent location, tidy room and price,1)The hotel would daily offer cleaning services for our room. 
2)They have a common room such as a kitchen, lounge and laundry room. Everybody has their own bathroom but they also have a common toilet.
3)Fast WiFi 
4)Great location üìç
5)Vending machine

Wenn man alles so modern wie m√∂glich machen m√∂chte w√§re es gut eine Beschreibung von allem im Zimmer zu haben um Sachen nach zu schlagen wie z.B das Licht oder Heizung diese funktionnieren √ºber einen kleinen Bildschirm, aber wie man die Temperatur einstellen konnte war ein bisschen konfus.
Der Fernseher war ein Apple TV, sodass man keine normalen Sender hatte und da alles √ºbers Handy l√§uft wie alle T√ºren entriegeln darf man dieses auf keinen Fall im Zimmer vergessen und sollte am Besten voll geladen sein. Dies ist meckern auf h√∂chstem Niveau, aber das w√§ren Verbesserungsratschge,War sehr warm im Zimmer, Klima konnte nicht regulieren und Fenster konnte man nicht √∂ffnen.,L‚Äôemplacement et la propret√©,La Dominique pour r√©cup√©rer la cl√©.

Silvia & Alvaro,Clean, new, comfortable,The team - Christophe & Pascal were excellent hosts - caring for our every need. We were delighted to have their company & service during our stay. Nothing we asked for was too much trouble . Pascal even waited with us for our taxi to the airport - a nice unexpected touch . We have wonderful lasting memories of our stay.,Beautiful, modern design, new with thoughtful details. Friendly and available staff. Spotlessly clean, nice bedding and towels. Excellent hearty breakfast served personally by Pascal. 

The set up is unusual as there are three private locked suites that share common space, including cooking and dining. We did not see the other guests, but this arrangement would be especially ideal for three couples traveling together. Quiet and safe neighborhood.,It was a wonderful stay in La Source during my stay in Paris. Great location: city center, safe and surrounded by good restaurant. Room size is very decent with lovely balcony for fresh air! All facilities are new and clean. Pascal and David showed their hosipitality everyday made us feel like home:) love to come back again.,The apartment concept didn‚Äôt feel like an Airbnb. Each room had its own security door similar to that of a traditional hotel. The shared living and dining space was great. Most of the time those areas are empty and provide for quiet relaxation, but it was very enjoyable to mingle with the other guests during breakfast and dinner.,Easy to access, great neighbourhood and beautiful place.

This property was amazing! To be honest, when I was searching for places to stay, this property actually seemed too good to be true. It had everything I was looking for, in the perfect location central to everything, a balcony, breakfast, and TONS of space!! Turns out this property was even better than I imagined. When I was searching for reviews on the property, I couldn't find much...that's because it was so brand new! So now I'm leaving a GREAT RECOMMENDATION of my own! I loved every second... the technology of the apartment was next level, the architecture, decor, AND the host Jule and Paschal were excellent! I can't say enough how their presence enhanced the trip. 

I enjoyed the conversation with them each day. Their passion for hospitality was evident! My journey would not have been the same without them. They met and anticipated every need without being overbearing. They were SPELNDID!! Loved it!

"5 Rue des Carmes, 5th arr., 75005 Paris, France",Hotel des Carmes by Malone,"Nothing to mention,Nothing really that would have impacted my stay.,Hotel notified that visit was celebration of birthday and anniversary, some complimentary would have been nice,Nothing,The cleaning lady sometimes just took the towels without leaving us the new ones, the same thing with the soap. 
And, the fire alarm woke us up twice, it turned out that it was a false alarm due to some spa issues, but it definitely woke up the entire hotel...,√ëA, we loved our stay!,The towel warmer in the bathroom was not working.,No complaints,The room is a bit small and is difficult to open big suitcases.,Slamming doors at all hours that would make walls shake.,Restocking the coffee pods would have been appreciated for a 2 night stay- only two pods were given for two people for the entire stay. 
Fridge didn't work, we thought it was the fridge settings but it was not, which was annoying as we had food that we needed to throw as it went off.
Hotel couldn't help with providing ice.,The hotel confirmed an early checkin, but when we have arrived, the room was not ready for another couple of hours. It is inconvenient. Please don‚Äôt misguide visitors with false promises.,Had to wait for an hour to check in due to turning over rooms. Initially we were placed in a room right next to the lobby; it is fantastic that the hotel has an option for those with disabilities but we did not need such accommodations and did not love that location. Fortunately, we voiced our concerns to the hotel and they promptly offered us a different room on another floor, which we loved, so 10/10 for service and responsiveness to guests.,Nothing. All was great,Rooms are a bit small. I travelled with kids and there barely any space left outside of the bed,Nothing. Everything was great.,All of it,Water pressure in the attachable shower was really weak in one of the most expensive rooms. So weak that you just can‚Äôt use it. Women will understand. I‚Äôm talking about hygiene. Manager said it was all the same in all rooms. But it wasn‚Äôt. We discovered that when we switched to a cheaper room. It wasn‚Äôt great. But better. 

Nespresso pods won‚Äôt be renewed. That‚Äôs weird for a four star hotel. Even weirder is that you don‚Äôt get new cosmetic kits with cotton swabs and stuff. 

TV didn‚Äôt work. I don‚Äôt need it. But it was paid‚Ä¶,no laundry,Nothing, it was all good.,Nothing to mention, it was great!,The room is not big but we Just had to sleep there so not a big problem.,na,quiet and modern style,Nothing really. Too short !,Room is really small, even in French standards.,Maybe more options for breakfast.,Size of room and cost of breakfast.,The room wasn‚Äôt huge but we didn‚Äôt feel cramped. Nothing really to dislike.,It was really nice so nothing negative,Absolutely Nothing. üòÄ. 
No reason to dislike anything about this hotel.,Although cognisant of the prices of Paris hotels especially during the summer of 2024 Olympics, I believe that the value for money equation should be considered again to gain traction with good clients in the longer term,The rooms are a little tight for space.,Expensive,The housekeeping did not wash our coffee cups and replenish the coffee and bottled water on day 2. So we had to leave the used cups in the bathroom sink to ‚Äúremind‚Äù them to wash. Thankfully they top up the bottled water on the 3rd day.,There was nothing I didn't like.,Nothing, it was all fantastic,Small details that could be improved: hair conditioner is not offered; bedside tables are too small with no drawers; clothes hangers are of the anti-theft kind which is inconvenient; breakfast didnt look appealing at all.,Rooms are small! And they can do better with breakfast.,All is good,N/A,Size of the room, but that is usual in Paris,1 night was too short, didn't have time to relax in the hammam.,I loved everything about this hotel, the room on the ground floor next to the little garden was beautiful, but we were woken up early due to the noise from the breakfast lounge. Its no one's fault but being so close to the breakfast area creates an early alarm clock if you plan to sleep in.,All was great,We didn't have breakfast at the hotel. It looked limited and expensive for what it was. There are so many local cafes that we enjoyed eating there rather than having to eat at the hotel.,Small room, but probably normal for Paris,Nothing, room was a bit small but that‚Äôs Paris for you!,Small room,The room was very small","First of all, the hotel team. They are very friendly and always ready to help.

The rooms were very clean, beds were comfortable and environment was very quiet for a good night‚Äôs sleep.
The shower/ rain shower was strong enough and the bathroom is well designed in that although it is small, there is enough room to turn around. 
They provide bottles of water and drinks and there is also a Nespresso machine with capsules and tea bags. 
As it just completed its renovation in Jan , everything smells new and looked very clean. 

The front desk team were very friendly and helpful. They speak very good English and helped us get a taxi to the airport hotel. It is very easy to get a taxi at that location and the fare wasn‚Äôt very expensive. It is about ‚Ç¨45-50 but can go up to about ‚Ç¨60+ if you get caught in a jam. It is considered reasonable especially if you have big luggages and want to avoid the crowd and pickpockets at RER stations.,The room was very comfortable and clean and had such a lovely view of the neighborhood. The bed was really comfortable and breakfast was delicious. We were in town for a concert at Accor Arena, and even though we could have taken a train or le uber, we opted to walk and it was a really nice stroll from the hotel along the Seine.,Exceptional boutique hotel, beautiful room with stunning views.

"175 ter rue de Tolbiac, 13th arr., 75013 Paris, France",H√¥tel Ambre,"Breakfast was 7:30 - 10:30 but probably set out early & left uncovered until you ate it. Except the yoghurts that were in the fridge. 
Because they didn‚Äôt know what time you‚Äôd be there to eat it. 
Paper squashy cups, a health & safety issue due to the hot fluids inside, but if you order a breakfast a proper mug is available.,The car park,Location is not the best but still okay, you see it before the booking so you know is it close to your POI. It is 15eur Uber to Notre Dame so it's fine for me.

Maintenance in room can be improved (one light out, bath plug missing),Most of the staff were great and friendly. However the staff member on Saturday morning at the counter was unfriendly and arrogant.,I was on the 4th floor and for once it was noisy - I think I must have been near the laundry room. This is the first time ever in many stays so I am assuming I just got unlucky! Normally very quiet although close to bars and restaurants,Staff were . . . distant let's say.,It is not a place to stay longer with group of people.

Queen size bed felt a bit small,The sheets were clean but there were black hairs everywhere, in bed and on the floor.,Room space,the noises were very loud in the room. We went home in the middle of the night and the noises of the other guests as the door slamming, talking, etc., penetrated so much. we could hardly sleep. Spots on bedding. Toalett also not so clean.,Wash Room not to expectation, Shower has to have a shield, Whole washroom floor gets wet after shower, Noet done,The room was smelling cigarette smoke.,We got an awful experience with check-in. The receptionist was very rude, disrespectful and unhelpful.,The staff was not very friendly and some spoke English poorly.The building was a little shabby but sufficient.,There was problem with heat, rooms should be warmed up before guests arrives,First floor rooms,Small double size bed,Maybe some water in the room...,The breakfast is not cost effective,The people at the reception couldve been more friendly. The bathroom floor was not really clean, but the room was in my opinion.,Staff, broken TV, airco didn‚Äôt work the first 2 days, hairdryer was working half. We said it and the answer was ‚Äúokej‚Äù,On the day of the arrival, the receptionist was not too kind, he was talking on phone during my checkin with some friend and didnt even think about to hang it up or say sorry. It was hard to understand who he is talking to. He was also not flexible regarding small requests. On the last day, the other receptionist was much nicer.,Difficult to park as needed to go to hotel first to find out where but wasn‚Äôt anywhere to stop. Not a big deal though.,Bed small,After I think around 5pm (not sure), the entree doesn‚Äôt open automatically, and you have to call for staff, which can sometimes take a few minutes, which can be inconvenient if it rains or something. Furthermore, we had to go to the reception two times in two days because our hotel key card wasn‚Äôt working anymore and we couldn‚Äôt enter our room.,The bathroom window catch was broken, but this was not a big deal.,Room is toooo small and the bed frame extrudes outside the mattress significantly. So you have to be very careful not to get hurt when you get around the room . 

And the reception guy is not very nice to guests.

Breakfast is way too simple that we skipped the breakfast for the rest of the stays.,The things that didn‚Äôt work.,Beds were uncomfortable , mattress was too soft, rather small for 2 people.,One of the towels was dirty.
Noise from cleaning in the morning (from 8 a.m.).
There is no kettle in the room.,the staff weren‚Äôt very helpful at times.
the shower room was too open and everything got wet.
room was cramped for a family of three adults,There is a musty smell in the hotel and rooms,Value for money;
I imagined a more spacious room but it was fine for just few days in Paris;,Room was a bit on the small side.,The staff weren‚Äôt the kindest.,The hotel front-door was closed after 12pm. You received a code to enter, but if you forgot this you have a challenge. 7*24 support would be nicer.,wifi was bad first day, after was ok. could have been better. tv was limited. kitchen was not 100%,Hosts and smell,We did not like the pillows, but everyone has their own taste.,Nothing,It seems that it is allowed to smoke in the rooms and some people do it. The smell propagates through the ventilation unfortunately.,The bath tub was broken. We had to put a glass over the drain to get the water to stay in the tub. The place was also noisy by the window.","Free parking (mention in advance)

We had a room with a great balcony, that was so nice,The hotel was placed very near to metro stations, bus stops, supermarkets and restaurants.,The room was basic but smart and clean. What I did not realize was that there was a fridge, hot plate and microwave oven in a small kitchenette area, with cutlery and crockery, meaning it was fully self contained for a self catering stay in Paris. A continental breakfast was available, and a coffee machine was in reception for unlimited free hot drinks.
It was also just 6 minutes walk from a Metro station on a very useful line. It was a relatively quiet area as well, with a choices of cafes not too far away.

And the Tolbiac Metro is just a short walk away to link you to central Paris.,We looked for a hotel with a parking place for a descent price in Paris city centre.

"94 Boulevard Garibaldi, 15th arr., 75015 Paris, France",Sublim by Sweett,"Just a little bit smaller than I expected and wouldve loved if i had a view of the eiffel tower.,Rooms needed a little maintenance,location. a bit far out from me.,nothing,The room was really small for two people with luggage,Shower door didn't open all the way as the floor is angled,Elevator too narrow, room had a smell like someone smoke or something,I was able to listen people from another room,The only thing to improve is the cleanliness, by that I mean one chair was a bit dirty so we did not use it, but that's ok. 
Overall, the bathroom and beds were clean.,The lobby part is very small and closes in the evenings. But it‚Äôs an anatomous hotel, so it makes sense no one is left at the lobby but could still keep a small lobby area open.,Check in 4pm checkout 11am not so good.,Unfortunately the rainfall showerhead seal had gone so it didn‚Äôt work well. We also found the toilet to be very uncomfortable as you would stand up into the basin essentially. Other than being small and tight bathroom space, the space was perfect,Shower was blocked on the first day so we couldn‚Äôt use it after a night out. It was fixed before we returned late in the evening but was a shame they had no free rooms for us to shower in. Also expected the balcony to have furniture so we could enjoy a breakfast as the picture suggested. It appears none of the balcony‚Äôs did from what we could see. It was the defining factor in why we picked this place over another.,Nothing; thank you Sweet Inn :),We needed invoice but the hotel was a bit slow providing that. But if you are on holiday, this should not be a problem.,The tv set did not work properly.,Communication with the staff.,Extremely loud. I barely got any sleep at night.
Check-in starts at 4 pm, so it‚Äôs best to plan your arrival around that time.,Near metro station,The elevator broke down the day of my check out,No permanent reception
No room service
Broken lightbulb
Room was not cleaned during stay,The room somehow smelled strongly of mothballs or like someone had tried to cover up smoking and there were tears in the curtain.,Small and you can see through the shower door.,Room size could be an issue if you have large suitcases.,A little bit noisy - street.,No breakfast, but very close to a good boulangerie where you can sit outside with a coffee.,Sound insulation between rooms was not good,Shower is transparent‚Äîit‚Äôs not convenient when you are not traveling with significant other
Room and shower are both a bit small,The fact that I asked for 30 min extra for check out and I received an automatic answer that they cannot do, without trying or showing that they would try but :-( 
Anyway. 
I would also like to have the possibility to speak to someone there if there are questions. It was too ""automatic"" everything which loses the personal ambience a little bit.
Then the colours inside the room were a little bit too much in the eye but I suppose some people like them as such l.... I would prefer something more gentle in terms of colours and light effect they had.,the Wi-Fi never worked,No Wi-Fi due to road works which meant also no TV.
A bit dusty,the Wi-Fi wasn‚Äôt working and that was something I did not like,I did not receive my keycode in time and no reaction on either mail or phone. lucky a colleague was there to help,I recently stayed at this hotel, which claims to have been renovated, but my experience left much to be desired. While my room was equipped with standard modern amenities, it felt run down overall, far from what you'd expect at the advertised price. The quality simply doesn't match the cost, leaving a disappointing gap in value for money. For the rate charged, I expected a much higher standard of upkeep and attention to detail. Not worth the expense, in my opinion.,Climbing up 6 flights of stairs wasn‚Äôt too fun but not too bad either.,NO BALCONY FOR LAST FLOOR,The rooms are a little small. The elevator is quite small and old.,The only thing I would suggest is a place to hang your towels.,The bathroom was tiny and the hot water did run out,Too small room,Maybe that there is a bussy street near, so there was quite noisy, but that‚Äôs not so bad, I mean its Paris, you shouldnt expect birds and forest sounds üòÇ,The online check in was something I didn‚Äôt like. I was on the go while booking the hotel and had to upload my travel documents on their app. It was a bit frustrating as the app kept getting stuck. So bear that in mind while booking this hotel to keep your passport etc with you and spare sometime.,Rooms were clean allthough the headboard above your head was full of dust.,Poor internet connection.
Very Small space to enter into the shower Room 501. Any fat or athletic person would not be able to get into the shower in this room.
No new bottle of water every day.,Not that we didn‚Äôt like, but we didn‚Äôt know that the shower room was glass and could see everything. We were mother and adult daughter so not the end of the world for us but might be worth making this clear. Also no hooks or rails to hang towels or coats and the toilet door handle kept coming off - minor repair but small things make a difference. Also the lift is tiny so not disability friendly if that is a need.,Heavy use of room fragrance too much for me,Room was very small but cozy. The heater in the bathroom was broken. The bidet also not working, and water drain in sink was very poor. Pillows very thin,When I took the elevator this morning, it didn't work, but it worked again two minutes later.,With the check in time being 4pm the hotel offer luggage storage service, unfortunately this is not well though as to enter the hotel before 11 you need a special code that is activated at 4 pm for your check in.
Keep it in mind in case you arrive in the city in the morning as you will be kept outside in the cold. 
Mattresses unfortunately extremely uncomfortable,Tiny room,Not very clean shower, toilet and the carpet. On the corridor, floor 4th persistent smell of bins/rubish.,There‚Äôs no bin in the room and we only got one pair of slippers, but no biggie!,Room was smaller than expected but manageable and still practical.,nothing, really,n/a","The room was perfectly located right in front of the metro and easy access to everywhere.

The location is also excellent, with the main Metro line 6 being right outside the door and some wonderful restaurants right around the corner.,Good location with Metro access to everywhere, quite neighborhood, clean and very compact room with everything you need. Very good value at the time of the Olympics. Had complimentary coffee in the room and in the lobby.

The bed was super comfortable with a good quality mattress. The layout of the room was well thought out with everything to hand. The soundproofing was excellent. 
A very decent size room which was a nice surprise in Paris!

Loved having the balcony even tho we didn‚Äôt have much of a view,Good view from the hotel,Everything!,The location is perfect right next to metro. But the room is small similar to other hotel rooms in the vicinity but the design of this room made things a bit difficult for us. They have placed tables and chairs in the room that block the walking space to go to rest room and no place left to put your luggage anywhere. Don‚Äôt know about other rooms. Eiffel Tower view is only from upper floors.,Self service checken.

"1 RUE DE L'ISLY, 8th arr., 75008 Paris, France",HOTEL DU PRINTEMPS,"Nothing, maybe the WiFi could be better,‚Ä¢ When we got to the room we were a bit disappointed. The room we got was not among the photos published by the hotel, so we were expecting a nicer room that did not overlook the backyard. 
‚Ä¢ Check in, as indicated, is at 15:00. We thought we could check in earlier, but we still arrived at 15:00 and had to wait a while to check in and go up to the room. 
‚Ä¢ Nothing else: I would still recommend this hotel; I think its location and price is the best thing about it.,Can only get the room after three pm.

Only a handheld shower.,It is quite acoustic. You can hear footsteps from the room above. There is no safety box, so we locked our stuff in the luggage.
The breakfast was poor, so we gave up on it after the first day. For less money, you can eat at the bakery around the corner.,We found it odd there was no safe in the room however, we had no issues with our stuff.

Nice showers,The location and the very friendly and professional staff: Mr Moumen and Mr Dominique.,Great location, close to transport, major attractions and restaurants.

Large room with lots of closet space and a bathroom with a full bathtub perfect for a nice for a soak after a long day of walking. Air conditioning made hot days and nights comfortable.,Excellent location. You can walk everywhere from hotel. My room was small but enough. It was pretty clean, it has a small balcony and it was nice to watch the city from here. There are beautiful venues very close by and within walking distance of attractions such as the Louvere.,1) Hotel itself is vintage but clean and the location is perfect , close to everything.

2) Room cleaning was perfect 

3)A/C was very helpful during our stay,The location of the hotel is excellent,The space was enough for one person. I loved how clean, neat, and well-facilitated the bathroom was. I also liked that there was another door inside the room. The wardrobe had several hangers and extra shelves, which was very convenient to arrange my stuff. The location is just perfect. The staff were very kind and sincere. I don't think I could get a place like this with this price in Paris.,location and cleanliness.,It was perfectly clean and great location.,I traveled alone to see Paris and enjoy the scenery. This hotel was perfect in the middle of everything bars and shopping malls. I loved and enjoyed my stay. The place was exceptional clean staff was very helpful. I definitely will go back there.,location is perfect , comfortable bad ,good place to visit Paris,Breakfast was not included, unfortunately. The location was perfect for our needs.,I really wanted to like the hotel. And weirdly enough I did even though this hotel is so contradictory to most hotels I stayed in in Paris.

The hotel is quirky and different. It started with the receptionist who after warming up turned out to be brilliant. It continued with getting a real key (!!!) to the room with a twist. The doors to the rooms are equipped with a vault like opening mechanism. I thought it was brilliant after I got used to it.
 
The room itself was by far the biggest I have had in Paris in this price category. MASSIVE actually. Loved it.

The wallpaper and furniture reminded me more of a monastery. All very minimalistic and more functional than a feast for my eyes. But, weirdly enough, I did not mind it. Bed was super comfortable, there is a small fridge, small table and chairs. Big bonus for travelers with lots of luggage is the separate storage room.

The TV from the pre-war era was smaller than the screen of my car entertainment system and meters away from the bed. Hey, I never used it and was reading instead and catching up with sleep. 

Bathroom was the only room which was done up. Very nice and super water pressure in the shower up in the fifth floor. 

One thing that I could not get over was the lack of a coffee machine or even coffee making tools, like a water cooker of coffee powder. BIG NO NO. In all fairness they do offer very affordable delicious breakfast in house. Nice coffee and fresh bred and pastries. Loved it.

I get the impression that they are doing their own thing and I actually find it refreshing. So I will definitely book again next time in Paris. All in all, I can highly recommend this hotel !!!,pretty foyer; big room; great location,The property gave me all the comfort and needs I wished to have during my stay:),Rooms were small but clean. Location is at center of city near metro, bus and train station which good for moving around. Staff was also very friendly.,Superior double room was really big. Each dat they changed our towels.

Recommend coming early, late, or having breakfast in room.,Little space to unpack clothes,Not a lot of hanging space as there is no closet, per se, but not an issue for us with just 4 night stay.

But that detail is so small when everything else was perfect!,NIL,The rooms were a bit small for our family‚Äîprobably better suited for couples,The key room was not working properly
The safe was not working but it was repaired sweefly 
The shower glass was not big enough so the floor got wet easily,There were construction works next door so sometime the drilling noise was uncomfortable. But this is temporary for the time I stayed at the hotel.,There was noise pollution from the construction site nearby but it didn‚Äôt bother us much as it didn‚Äôt start until 9am and we were already up by then,Metro connections to the city center are not great.,It would be even better if could proactively provide disposable slippers and toothpaste.","Every single thing about this hotel was exceptional. You could smell how clean and new it was walking through the halls. The room was spotless and extremely comfortable.

They are baked on the premises and the smell wafts through the air so you know you are in Paris. The neighboring streets have lots of ethnic and French restaurants and Pantheon and Luxembourg Gardens are just few minutes walk away. There's a bus stop in front and saw that these buses go to Louvre, and other tourist sites so riding regular city bus would be cheap way to get around.

Also, not enough space in the bathroom either to put your stuff,The rooms are very small but I guess that's what you expect in a capital city.,The location is a bit far from central Paris. There is a metro station called Porte de Lilas across the street from the hotel which we used daily. It takes approximately 20-30 minutes boarding multiple trains to reach multiple tourist destinations. Also, the heater was turned on automatically at night and could not be changed. Front desk controls this for the whole floor and when someone gets cold at night they turn the heat on. This was the only problem we had but 3 out of the 5 nights the A/C was on at night.","The concept in which the hotel is based is quite practical, the room looks spacious and it was very comfortable, not to mention that the people who were at the front desk were very kind.

The location is really good both for public transportation and for taxis. Both the lunch/dinner at the restaurant and the breakfast downstairs were delicious every time. The food also has a relatively good price and the bakery next door tops it off even more. I could go on all day long but the absolute best part of our stay was the staff. The cleaning crew keeps everything tidy and they are very polite and helpful, the breakfast crew and the restaurant waiters are super nice and last but not least the receptionist are above and beyond.

Value was decent.,The location was great, outside of the city in an area that felt spacious with lots going on around and within walking distance of attractions.

There was Wi-Fi, and towels, toilet rolls and showers wash. We were visiting family in the area so stayed local and plenty of shops, eateries in the area. Plus a huge park not far away.,Wifiin the room was inadequate., should not be tolerated w2,The hotel was located near one of the main subway station (Nation) that has connection to Airport and main city points (3 minutes walk) .

Very professional and friendly staff.,Room was gorgeous, very comfortable and luxe. Just down the road from a metro stop so easy to get to. Pool and sauna area is spectacular, really added to our stay. Great cafes and restaurants a short walk away.,The communication with the hotel, prior to arrival, via booking.com messenger was excellent. I had actually booked Hotel Vinci, but cancelled and changed to Monte Cristo, due to their lack of proper communication.
Monte Cristo booked us hotel transfers prior to arrival, gave me hotel recommendations, booked our pool access, and were on hand at all times to answer all questions to allow us to fully enjoy the experience! 

We were also very grateful for the excellent cleaning service provided through our stay. Our room was kindly cleaned and replenished daily, a lovely treat after a days exploring the city.

We found the room beautiful and very Parisian, the size was very good - we booked the deluxe, I believe a lot of rooms in Paris are small, this room size and bathroom were perfect. The window doors opened up beautifully as shown in the images.

We slept very comfortably.

We walked into the stunning Latin Quarter daily, the popular Rue Mouffetard area had the best vibe and was so safe and welcoming. I found all Parisians more than happy to help and be kind, the streets immaculate. 

We found the best way to get around the city was to download the V√©lib app and to cycle using the electric bikes. Minimal effort required and cycle lanes everywhere.
Tip - green bikes are manual, teal colour electric. There is a drop off / pick up point end of our street. 

I wouldn't recommend Lime bikes as they need to be left within Paris city boundaries, not as far up as Latin Quarter.

Would also recommend Bateaux Parisians evening meal cruise with a window seat - pre book online & hotel
will book you taxi. Also recommend cycling to Montmartre, absolutely stunning! Although cycle fast via 10th Arr. Moulin Rouge is also over this side. 
I found the metro intimidating so electric bikes were our choice of travel.,Everything,Modern and interesting decoration. Spacious room.,Lovely boutique hotel.. such really nice staff..

Great facilities and lovely room. No complaints.,The hotel is located in a great place, in my favorite part of Paris (I lived nearby during my studies and I have great fondness for the fifth arrondissement). Very comfortable beds, great cosmetics and a very pleasant interior of the hotel and the room itself. The service was very helpful. Another advantage was that the room was very quiet and you couldn't hear the Parisian bustle. Fantastic pool reservation system (available until 2 AM). A big plus (and surprise) was the bar, where you can try cocktails made with rum from different parts of the world.

Some messengers weren't available through the Wi-Fi,We stayed in the building past the courtyard which didn‚Äôt have a lift and we were on the third floor. The stairs were very narrow which made it difficult with our luggage, however the first building did have a lift so I would request to stay here instead.,There were too many emails connected to the stay. I counted more than 25 - which is really excessive for a regular booking.,The sofa was so uncomfortable that you almost couldn‚Äôt sit in it without hurting your back. The wifi for our floor didn‚Äôt work at all, fortunately we piggybacked off wifi from another floor but the signal was weak. Cell phone signal strength very low at only 1-bar. The apartment was missing even the most basic supplies, no salt, pepper, teabags, sugar, vinegar and oil etc. otherwise kitchen had basic dishes required.,The WiFi connection was terrible. They hot water for the shower ran out too soon and they only gave a tiny little tube that was a multipurpose shower/shampoo gel,I couldn't get cell reception, but that could be a google fi issue. However, wi-fi connection was close to zero.,The washer/dryer was not user friendly and made heavy noise and shook violently.,WiFi didn't work, but we didn't need it.,One of the lamps was placed really low, and I kept hitting it with my head, very annoying.,The lift can only carry one person at a time but better than not having a lift at all to the 4th floor. I would suggest to have air conditioning in the unit (bedroom and living room) as it gets very warm during the summer although a fan was provided when we requested for it on day one. Toiletries can also be improved to better quality ones. Also, the bathroom needs hooks so you can hang towels/clothes and a rack for toiletries inside the shower area. The drain in the shower also became slow on our day 3. The wifi network wasn't working during our whole stay, I have raised the issue to them but no solution was given until we checked out. You can connect to their available networks but there is no internet at all.,We couldn‚Äôt find pots or pans if we wanted to cook a meal . Plenty of cutlery and crockery tho. We just enjoyed eating out!,The staff provided the details of how to get into the house before my arrival. However, they forgot to give me the passcode of the second door of the building. We texted them but no reply. Finally, I borrowed a phone from a restaurant and called them to get the passcode. We had waited for more than one hour. 
There was a small new lift for carrying luggages but it was still not in service. We had to carry 4 suitcases to the fifth floor and the staircases were very steep.,The instructions to enter the apartment were somewhat confusing and incomplete‚Äîhad to call to get one of the codes. The motion sensor light in the courtyard was very bright at night.,Bed area is tight when sofa bed folded out. Very comfortable though!,Some kitchen appliances didn‚Äôt work. And the kitchen had some leaking problem. Although amended immediately still affected the pleasantries of staying there in the beginning.,It was pretty noisy on the Saturday night from the bar below but fine noise wise the other nights we stayed. The Wifi was also a bit intermittent.,- the wifi rarely worked 
- be aware the lift is very small- you have to send one suitcase up at a time (without you) and even a travel pram must be folded up.,Small spot of area not cleaned properly, however, the online host organized another cleaning for me. They responded back to me during weekend which was good experience. If you are living at building B then you better have a strong body to carry baggage upstairs by hand. We had 2 pieces of 23kg luggage and the stair was so narrow. It took me lot of time to move luggage up to 4th floor.. Almost dead.,slight smell in bathroom and fan noise at night, but not a big deal. entry is a bit complicated with four codes to get through,Had very bad experience in checking in as the code provided for the lockbox was wrong and I want able to get the key and stayed outside for hours trying to call someone to give me the correct code. After this when I asked these hours to be added to extend my check out time , the answer was ‚Äúsorry we can‚Äôt accommodate your request ‚Äú. What a joke! But you can send me the wrong code so I won‚Äôt be able to check in!!,The WiFi didn't exist, there was no WiFi.
The apartment had very little furniture, it felt sparse.
This is the first time ever with booking.com that I've had to secure a ‚Ç¨500 deposit, would it not be better to check my rating.
The booking was just a hassle, message after message... Pay the deposit, reminder pay the deposit, what time will you arrive and to top it all they asked for a departure time before we arrived.

The host was very attentive, always ready to help us and was a good communicator,The room was very clean, comfortable and modern. We had a very good rest. The dining room and kitchen are also very cozy. Location close to Montmartre, supermarkets, Metro, etc. Fatenne was a great host, always friendly, kind and quick to respond! Access and check in was easy for us even in the midnight, coming from Bercy station.,Nice freshly renovated rooms. Everything was clean and pleasant. Good breakfast with croissants and other baked goodies fresh each morning. The location itself is good, the hotel is located in an inner backyard, isolated from street noise and people.,Very clean, conveniently located, the rooms are exactly like in the pictures. The bathroom even had a window! Lovely and comfortable stay.,It was freshly renovated and was very close to the metro station!,everything was great, the room was clean and comfortable, the breakfast was delicious, the personal was friendly and kind! good hotel :),The kindness of the staff. Beautiful, clean room. Access to nearby Metro. Vibrant neighbourhood.,The location was really convenience, you can easily find Metro 4 and 12 nearby. Fatenne is a super friendly lady who helps a lot.

The property exceptional, the room ultra comfortable and clean, but the best was the host and the breakfast !!! Highly recommended,Maison Geranium is a haven in a popular and bustling region of Paris.

The Metro stop is only 2 minutes walk away so reaching any part of Paris is fairly straightforward.,The host was so kind and helpful!,We've been wonderfully hosted by Fatenne. She cared about every little detail that made our stay really comfortable even though it was only two nights. The room matches the photos from the website. We warmly recommend this place and, for sure, be back on our next trip to Paris.,An easy walk (even on a warm day) to Sacre Coeur, also for a 7 year old child. A beautifully renovated old Parisian building, superbly quiet and clean. Breakfast was ample continental fare, with a selection of (French) cheeses, bread and fruit, juice, coffee, hot chocolate. The breakfast setting had an intimate, homey feel. Communication on arrival required internet ( WhatsApp) or a SIM card (phone), and the cafe Ola, a block up, was a lovely place for a refreshment and internet. We were able to get a perfect night's sleep, even with the windows open. Walking to Sacre Coeur through the local neighborhoods was (for us) a welcome change from the more heavily touristy areas. We found Maison Geranium a peaceful.oasis of calm ...even in Paris during the opening days of the Olympics! And the host spoke perfect English (as well as French, of course). It was also a very short and easy walk to a metro station, to explore other parts of Paris. We (a mother and 7 year old) comfortably and easily walked the neighborhood.,Very charming guest house ! Newly refurbished and decorated with taste. The outside space is a really lovely and rare to find in Paris. It was nice being able to sit outside and enjoy the sun.

Proximit√© du metro,L accueil de Fatenne !
La chambre confortable, propre et la cour privative.,Wundersch√∂nes G√§stehaus, geschmackvoll und sauber. Tolles Preis-Leistungsverh√§ltnis. Nahe an der Metro. Fatenne war sehr herzlich. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck war ausreichend und lecker.,EL INTERIOR ES MUY AGRADABLE Y LO NECESARIO PARA ESTANCIAS CORTAS. FATENNE MUY AMABLE. EL DESAYUNO BUENO.,Interesantan koncept doruƒçka, mala kuhinja s ponudom namaza, sira i peciva. Sasvim dovoljno za poƒçetak dana.
Kreveti su iznenaƒëujuƒáe udobni. ƒåistoƒáa je na zavidnoj razini.
Odmah po dolasku smo sru≈°ili posudicu za sapun i razbili, no domaƒáin nije oko toga pravio problem, rekao je da ne brinemo o tome. Najbli≈æa metro stanica je idealna za putovanje do svih lokacija koje u Parizu treba posjetiti.,Todo est√° muy nuevo, el desayuno estupendo, el trato con el alojamiento c√≥modo y sencillo, llegamos un poco antes de la hora y estaba lloviendo mucho y nos ofrecieron dejar el equipaje, y esperar dentro, incluso ten√≠an nuestra habitaci√≥n lista antes de la hora se√±alada! El espacio es peque√±o pero pr√°ctico (faltar√≠a un armario o un burro para la ropa), y muy confortable, con calefacci√≥n y ventanas.
Aunque est√° fuera de las zonas tur√≠sticas (Par√≠s es enorme) puedes ir andando a Montmartre, y est√° el metro 4 a unos metros del alojamiento, en esta l√≠nea llegas a las zonas de inter√©s, y te lleva a las estaciones donde hacer trasbordo a Disney y Versalles en unos minutos, pero calcula bien los tiempos, pues entre un metro y un tren, se te puede ir una hora de camino a tu destino.
El desayuno est√° muy bien, sin necesidad de a√±adir nada, el fin de semana no hay servicio, te lo preparas tu, en nuestro caso el s√°bado no hab√≠a pan ni pasteles por lo que nos fuimos fuera, pero no se si por que aun era temprano, o porque otros usuarios hab√≠an devorado todo o por que a la propiedad se le olvid√≥, tampoco hubo mayor problema.
Para los precios en los que se mueve la ciudad est√° muy bien este alojamiento, pero estudia los transportes, por precio y tiempo antes de decidir pues es una ciudad enorme y cara hasta para coger el metro.,Eine sehr sch√∂ne Unterkunft. Alles ist neu und sauber. 
Fatanne ist sehr freundlich und hat uns bereits am Anreisetag um 11:00 die Koffer unterstellen lassen. Am Abreisetag konnten wir problemlos bis mittags das Zimmer behalten, weil es mit unserer Abreisezeit so besser passte.
Das Fr√ºhst√ºck wird frisch zubereitet und war gut und ausreichend (Croissants, Pain au chocolat, Baguette, K√§se, Marmelade, S√§fte etc). Die Kommunikation √ºber whatsapp und email lief einwandfrei. Wir haben alles gut gefunden und das Einchecken lief auch ohne Rezeption einfach.
Uns hat die Gegend gut gefallen. Auch wenn sie von anderen Nutzern hier weniger positiv eingesch√§tzt wurde. Es ist ein buntes, multikulturelles Viertel mit viel Leben auf der Stra√üe. Wir haben uns in keiner Weise unsicher gef√ºhlt.
Wer mit Kindern anreist: es gibt einen kleinen, tollen Stadtbauernhof (le recyclerie) mit einem charmanten Cafe - 15 minuten zu Fu√ü entfernt direkt bei der Station Porte de Clignancourt. Auch ohne Kinder ein sch√∂ner Ort zum Verweilen (ge√∂ffnet Freitag bis Sonntags).,Fatenne war unglaublich nett. Sehr freundliche Kommunikation, auch schon vor der √úbernachtung. Die flei√üigen Zimmerm√§dchen haben mir einen zeitigeren Bezug des Zimmers erm√∂glicht. Vielen Dank nochmal daf√ºr. 
Das Zimmer war sauber und h√ºbsch eingerichtet. Das Bad war etwas klein, aber f√ºr einen kurzen Aufenthalt in Ordnung. 
Das Fr√ºhst√ºck wurde im Untergeschoss in der K√ºche serviert. Sehr lecker und alles, was man als St√§rkung f√ºr einen wunderbaren Tag in Paris braucht.,Fatenne war sehr nett und bem√ºht W√ºnsche zu erf√ºllen und Fragen zu beantworten.
Die Zimmer waren sauber und sehr sch√∂n eingerichtet.
Das Fr√ºhst√ºck war ausreichend und gut.
Die Lage ist etwas ""merkw√ºrdig"" - Abends sp√§t w√ºrde ich nicht alleine zum Hotel gehen wollen, aber in Begleitung war das okay.
Die U-Bahn ist in wenigen Minuten zu Fu√ü zu erreichen.,Fatenne ist eine supernette Gastgeberin die sich um alle Anliegen k√ºmmert. Kommunikation schon im vor Reiseantritt super. Wir konnten unsere Koffer problemlos vor Check-In lagern. Fr√ºhst√ºck wird am Tisch serviert. Zimmer sind sehr sauber und sch√∂n eingerichtet. Lage ist nur 5 Gehminuten von der Metro entfernt. Wenn wir nochmals nach Paris kommen, dann gerne wieder in diese Unterkunft!üòä,Emplacement tr√®s calme donnant sur une petite cour. Personnel √† l'√©coute et tr√®s r√©actif. Petit d√©jeuner copieux.

D√©licate attention des livres dans les chambres,Leuke schone en frisse accommodatie. Alles nieuw qua inrichting. Kamer en vooral bed wel klein voor 2 personen. De foto‚Äôs komen helemaal overeen met hoe het in het echt is. 
Prima ontbijt in de kelder van het complex: ook alles schoon fris en lekker, je kunt krijgen wat je wilt. 
Omdat het erg rustig was tijdens ons verblijf was het ook vooral ‚Äòdo it yourself‚Äô maar dat vonden wij juist leuk. Mooie grote keuken met alle apparatuur aanwezig. Het voelde een beetje alsof je thuis bent.

"13, rue des Ecoles, 5th arr., 75005 Paris, France",Hotel Minerve,"Everything was fine! just bathroom was small !,Hook to attach shower head to wall. Soundproofing not great. Fortunately we were not badly affected but could be a real issue if there were noisy guests nearby,Room was very small.,No hook for shower. Difficult to hold.
Deep bath to climb out of to shower.,Nothing,There's a hot drink and vending machine on the ground floor which is stocked with small bottles of water, amongst other things, but I'd have appreciated a water fountain being available to top up my water bottle.,Small room. No shampoo or conditioner.,Nothing I didn‚Äôt like but if there had been a bar it would have added to the experience of staying there,It would be nice to have a few drawers in the wardrobe in addition to hanging space.,All good, location, price and the facility was clean, well managed and maintained,Bathroom was small, could work with that but not the lack of privacy as the bathroom door did not seal. There were no hooks in the room or bathroom.,The hotel felt a little cramped with not a lot of space- however this seems common in Paris. Walls need to be soundproofed between rooms.,Courtyard view doesn‚Äôt offer a lot of natural light,The room and shower was really small but it is to be expected in central Paris. There is no mini fridge in the room we booked (basic twin bed with view over internal courtyard).,Seems a bit overpriced for the facilities,Shower water pressure was poor.,The elevator was unusually small! We had to go up to our room singularly with our luggage. One return to our room was with a third person; very uncomfortable (both in space and personal space!).
Otherwise, would recommend for your stay in Paris!,There is no high place to hang the shower head.,Room slightly small,Small elevator,Nothing really!,Nothing,A small fridge would have been nice for the bedroom.,Due to the age of the building, the rooms and facilities are slightly outdated and the room was extremely small! However, you know this from the pictures and can tell when booking. The super friendly staff and their willingness to help makes up for it!,a fridge in the room would be handy,small window!,Noisy road but it made no difference as I slept with the window open.,The elevator could barely hold my wife and I with a single small backpack. In addition, on hot days, the elevator became stuffy quickly. If we wanted to avoid the elevator, it was unclear how to get from the lobby to the stairwell going up,Room itself was small and not the easiest to move around in, however it was fine for a short stay 
Property is a bit dated now,Breakfast not included.,Not a fan of the location. Evening staff very abrupt and not helpful. Asked about bottled water and directed to a vending machine. Asked if there was a store nearby and his directions were to the Metro - for bottled water? Found a store just down the street. 
Our driver arrived at 6am to pick us up for the airport and was treated very badly by the staff. Threaten to call the police if they did not exit the building. Very unprofessional.,Before the trip we asked for brighter room (not with the view to the wall) and they promised to give us room with the street view. However, when we arrived, we had got room on the second floor with the view to the wall :) The second day they let us switch the room. So make sure that you‚Äôll get what you‚Äôve been promised and don‚Äôt be afraid to talk with staff.,The hallways, elevator, and bedroom were tight. Those were quite forgivable given the quality of everything else and the location.,There was nothing - and nobody - I didn‚Äôt like. Thanks everyone for making my stay so enjoyable.,Nothing. It was all just as I had hoped and the photos were accurate.,Room was without wifi, informed reception was working however our room 407 was in a black spot.,Would have loved an iron & ironing board. Hair dryer was not in the best condition.,Super small but we made it work,would like more choice in bed linens.,Breakfast could have been better, an exercise room would be nice.,Small lift but was doable.,WiFi- Staff tried their best but it did not work on floor 4.,Very dark room in the ground floor, you hear when a room above flushes the toilet,A bit hard beds.,Well, the rooms could have been a bit larger, but then this is Paris!! Guess space is at a premium.,Nothing really, it‚Äôs super well located, everything was clean and comfortable. I only didn‚Äôt like now that I remember that the suitcases or luggage was left to care but you don‚Äôt get any kind of ticket for it, so I was a bit nervous either guests could mistakenly take my luggage but thankfully it didn‚Äôt happen.,Super cozy elevator! Tiny shower without any shower shelf for toiletries.,Poor soundproofing. I could hear conversations clearly from the neighboring room and guests laughing and talking loudly in the hallway, as if they were in my room...at 2am!
The rooms are small but that can be expected in Paris.,The curtains in the room were either washed with an incredibly fragrant detergent or they were sprayed waaaay too strongly with a room fragrance. I‚Äôm not the most sensitive to smells but this was unbearable and I had to have the window open all night to be able to fall asleep. Except that, everything else was nice.,Nothing negative,No plant milk at breakfast,all facilities were there but room
was quite small. i do accept this is an old French building and this is is very typical of the type of property available in the area","Everything during our stay was great. From the beginning, the staff was extremely kind and helpful. We arrived earlier than expected so they kindly offered a place to leave the luggage and gave us a map. The wifi worked perfectly. The location was perfect for us; not too close to busy areas but still within walking distance from the city center. The room was bigger than we expected and in our case also had an internal balcony with chairs and a table. Everything was super clean and well taken care of.,Super Location and very nice friendly staff !24/7 reception and always friendly !

Very clean and breakfasts were good lots to choose from. Breakfasts 17 euros.,Great Location
Nice fresh deco in rooms. Clean.
Amazing staff.,Location, clean rooms , price,Close proximity to museums,Great location and easy to connect with metro and Batobus stops. We paid ‚Ç¨17 for breakfast and appreciated the wide range of items on offer and friendly and efficient service in the breakfast room. (It's not value for money if you simply want coffee and a croissant in the morning however.) Our room was at the back of the hotel and was very quiet, the bed was extremely comfortable. I would recommend the hotel to friends and family.,The location was perfect.,Staff were lovely, very helpful. My single room was small but had everything I needed.,It is nicely located in the Latin Quarters at a 5 minute walk from the metro, 15 min to Notre Dam. Lots of nice restaurants within walking distance. The staff was very helpful especially after I had a fall.,A very upscale facility a few blocks from the Seine near Notre Dame in the heart of where you want to be in Paris‚Ä¶Easy walking access from Gare de Lyon,Location; friendly, helpful staff;,superb location in central Paris, great eateries nearby. Notre Dame metro 10-15 minute walk and takes you directly to CDG airport. Jardin de Luxembourg within walking distance as are many other Parisian destinations.,The hotel was in a good location and the staff were very helpful. We loved to open the window to the courtyard.,Great location, 10 minute walk to Notre Dame, 25 minute walk to the Louvre. Close to the metro and bus stops. Room was very clean and comfortable.

Rooms were clean and modern staff were great,Location, pleasant staff,Upon arrival, the staff were very friendly and helped us store our bags as we were early. They also directed us to some clean bathrooms to freshen up. Our room was clean, very comfortable, and decently spacious. We really enjoyed the balcony. The surrounding area was very nice, walkable, and had good cafes.,Ideal location. Close to metro stations. Lots of restaurants close by. Lovely friendly staff and cute hotel.,The location was excellent and the style of the bedroom was lovely. The staff were helpful and friendly, especially in the breakfast room. The air conditioning was a lifesaver!,The staff at this hotel were simply incredible. From the cleaners to the front desk, every single person was warm and friendly and couldn‚Äôt be more helpful. The two people who were at the front desk during the day time just went above and beyond to make it a comfortable stay. It‚Äôs in the perfect location too! Would recommend!,staff were really nice - location is very good close to river and Parthenon,The location of the hotel is very good close to pantheon and a lot of restaurants.

Property was nice with small balcony
Nice and clean, modern bathroom,This apartment hotel is located in the 5th arrondissement of Paris.Undoubtedly, It has an excellent location. The gentleman at the reception is very friendly. The room is elegant, the bed is very comfortable, and the hot chocolate is delicious.,Location in St Germain 5th Arondissment was far enough away from the tourist chaos, and it was definitely a locals area, with great reasonably priced brassieres, patisseries, bars and restaurants, yet very convenient to many Metro stations, only 10mins walk to Notre Dame.,Well appointed room and beautiful bathroom, although not a shower, tub with a shower hose. 
Elevator very small.,Nice staff, good breakfast and location.,The staff was fabulous. Everyone was very kind and helpful. The beds were comfortable and the hotel was very clean.,I have been to Paris before, in the 60s, so a lot has changed since - nonetheless I liked everything. Even the teeny tiny lift (or elevator)! The hotel is genuinely old and of the period and elegantly decorated, so expect rooms which are not enormous - but no smaller than others of the same period. I had a tree-lined street view - of Paris, what more could I ask? The reception staff were lovely, helpful, thoughtful and humorous. The 5th Arrondissement is perfectly convenient. A short and delightful walk to the Seine and Notre Dame de Paris, to absorb the amazing progress being made on the restorations, walk the Boulevard Ste Germain and other notable roads. And dont miss ‚ÄúShakespeare & Co‚Äù , still operating in an area of bookshops (who‚Äôd ‚Äòa thought?). 
I could possibly have arranged to visit when the weather was less wet, but then I gave one of the hotel‚Äôs provided umbrellas an enthusiastic work-out.,I had a perfect 2 night stay here as a solo traveller and was lucky enough to have a room at the front with the flowers on the balcony. By far the best thing was the breakfast! Fresh apricots, fruit compote, an excellent cheese selection (as you would expect in France - none of the normal sweaty plastic cheese), delicate pastries and macaroons! I had a small room but it was just right for what I wanted and I was pleased that I went over my budget and chose this hotel. As a solo traveller this is a very good arrondissement.,Good locstion for sightseeing.,Great location. Staff were helpful & friendly. Room was comfortable & clean.

"295 Avenue Daumesnil, 12th arr., 75012 Paris, France",Motel One Paris-Porte Dor√©e,"Nothing. It's perfect!,Honestly, nothing! The staff was great, they even accommodated me for a room with a view of the Eiffel tower. Staff was so friendly, food breakfast clean rooms,Room was very small, with only a little amount of space to walk around the bed and not much space to the side of the room once you bring in luggage.,Everything was excellent,Nothing really to complain.,The fact they didn‚Äôt serve dinner,The property could have improved if there are more facilities in the room. For example, there was no fridge. There was no iron and ironing board. There was no kettle where you could make yourself a hot drink, which I think is normally standard in most hotels, but apart from those facilities that were lacking in the room, my experience at this hotel was lovely,Kettle/fridge would have been nice to have.,Not much, only comment would be that the room might be too small for someone that planned on staying in the hotel for long hours but perfect if you‚Äôre going to be out for most of the time,1. Everything was great . The only thing that would add more value is, to add a fridge in the room sometime in the future. There is no option to keep in room anything apart from solid foods that do not need freezer. This is kind of important , considering that the hotel does not offer lunch or dinner so there may be times that you need to pick some things up from the market. ( this is basically for long day stays, otherwise for 2-3 days anyone can live without fridge I suppose :) )
2. Location is close to metro which is perfect, however if it‚Äôs your first time in Paris and you want to walk instead of using transportation, prepare yourself for some long walks as 12th apartment is not very close to 3,4,5 apartments which are the coolest, as far as I am concerned,Room is a bit small,The location was a little far out from the main centre of Paris,Nothing,Breakfast... Not great if you have dietary restrictions,Potential to serve lunch and dinner instead of just toasties. Warm foods served at breakfast.,I had nothing to complain about! I will search for this brand in every country where it is present. It has very good RPC and much better than expected for a 3* hotel. Congrats!,It was extremely hot inside, both the lobby and the room. The thermostat wasn‚Äôt working in our room and the window only opened a small amount and it really was quite stifling. Our trip was short and we were out all day so didn‚Äôt ask anyone to look at it but I‚Äôm certain if I did the staff would have done everything they could to fix it.,I found the storage space was slightly limited (but I do have a tendency to over pack!) 
View of the busy road. 
No glasses in room.,No device to boil water,Nothing,Nothing much, but I feel as a service from the hotel, to at least have a shuttle to pick you up at the point, if you get there by train from the airport. It will make the experience much better otherwise I do not have complaints as they are very helpful.,All was fantastic,Nothing really,no fridge ..no coffee making facilities. although this seems standard in europe,Location is a little far out and breakfast was quite expensive, but overall an excellent stay,View on the very high traffic highway
Not much space in the room for dressing,Everything was perfect,Tight space in the room, no room for second chair,Slightly pricey,Nothing, everything was great,Small room; no washcloths and that breakfast was not included in the price. (As we experienced in Germany - with similar buffet and lower price/night),Price they told us there was different than normal price we checked online,Although close to the metro, it‚Äôs a bit far from most tourist attractions and it could take 45 minutes to an hour. If you aren‚Äôt into long distance, it may be a challenge. But the hotel itself, is excellent,We were very happy.,Room was a bit small and. Not much room to layout two suitcases,Front facade of the hotel is industrial and immediate area outside trafficked by cars so a little noisy and not as walkable as I'd expect for Paris (think Grand Army Plaza Brooklyn) and few upscale food options nearby for lunch or dinner (simple brasserie and takeout options). I was the only solo traveller in 20s-30s range as well, was more older couples and families during my stay,There were no negatives from my point of view.,Only issue was that is was so difficult to find any English program, and we unfortunately couldn‚Äôt AirPlay our phones to the tv.,Slightly far from the centre of Paris.,Nothing it was great,The rooms were clean bed was comfortable. Location is in good area though it was far from city,Nothing,Nothing,Limited food and drink choices.,Just a bit far from city centre,Location, not close to the center. BUT very close to public transportation and easy to travel around.,Expensive, thought i understand it is Paris,The room was a bit small, no fridge in the room and a bit far from central.","The best h√¥tel in Paris for qualit√© and Price! Location is amazing with wonderful views of bois de Vincennes, m√©tro, tram, bus stations everywhere around you. The area is very safe and calm and the local eateries are wonderful. 

The minute you enter the hotel, you are transported to a world of style and comfort. The reception in itself is a masterpiece of elegance and a very cozy atmosphere.
 
H√¥tel staff are always welcoming and helpful, the rooms are spacious, impeccable, comfortable and stylish with lovely turquoise accents and artwork everywhere (even the carpets)! 

The breakfast is fresh and delicious with lots of wonderful French pastry options, an all-in-one hot drinks machine, and a generous selection of tea, cheeses, cold cuts, fruits, yogurts, spreads, salad and fresh juices.

I feel at home whenever I visit Motel One Porte Dor√©e and it really feels like home!

We enjoyed our stay and would come again.,It was great; the bed was very confortable,The staff were very helpful and friendly, the room was perfectly cleaned everyday,I love that location was near a metro station, but it‚Äôs still had its own type of city vibe.

I liked the atmosphere as well, and the staff were extremely friendly helpful if you ever needed anything,The location is great for a short metro trip to anywhere in Paris. The bar is fantastic, good vibes and music and the most incredible chairs!! So many chairs.

Staff were very friendly, helpful, and welcoming.,The staff were great, the drinks were lovely and so was the room!,Modern, very nice lobby, great staff, offered us the room we asked for,Very good stuff.every thing is good,The 12th arr is close to some attractions and far from others depending where you want to be, but if you want to know what Paris is like on a daily basis, then the 12th Porto Doree, is perfect. The restaurants are close by and reasonable with authentic French food. The hotel provides you with restaurants to go to. It is close to a metro, bus stops and taxis whenever you need it.,Everything was excellent! It‚Äôs also in a nice part of Paris,Hotel was fantastic. Lovely staff and rooms.,The room first seemed a bit small, but not really actually. Everything is here and it is comfortable.

"32 rue des Ecoles, 5th arr., 75005 Paris, France",Hotel Les Bulles De Paris,"Room slightly worn down, leakage from shower wall.,Bathroom quite small, but to be expected in Parisian city hotel.,It's not a cheap hotel but it's very central and comfortable.,No fridge, breakfast could have been a little more varied but no real complaints about anything.,Nothing,There were a couple of things that could have been a little better, but didn‚Äôt impact the holiday at all. The cards to access the room randomly got deactivated during our stay, but this was easily rectified by the nice staff. I also thought the city tax was quite high but I imagine the hotel is not in control of this.,Toiletries were of very poor quality. The shampoo was not useable - left my hair like cardboard. No shower mat for standing out on. No face cloths,I had booked a room with 2 twin beds for myself and my friend that I was traveling with. Our room was upgraded to a suite, which was a very nice gesture, but the room only had one bed. One of us ended up sleeping on the couch. Also, there was no door on the bathroom, which made things a little awkward for us.,I personally found some of the decor slightly tacky, but that is personal preference and style. This didn‚Äôt affect our stay at all and I would still 100% stay here again.,The elavator.bit slow.,Rooms are very small,It was small in the bathtub near the rear of it due to an odd design. 
The room was small, yet we expected that, so overall, we had no issues of dislike.,I prefer to take a shower in the bathroom.:),The room was surprisingly small - but offset by the fact that the bed was very comfortable, the shower was clean and spacious, and I had a small balcony that I was not expecting. There really isn't anything else that I didn't like, it's a nice hotel and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a short stay to Paris.,Room was small but OK for one person.,Overall a splendid hotel,Tea/coffee facilities were not enough. There was a couch in the room, which we thought was unnecessary and the space could‚Äôve been used more for a proper kitchenette. There was no fridge in the room.,The price of the breakfast, which I thought was inclusive, bit of a surprise. My fault for not checking details - would have avoided and eaten it at the cafe opposite,small room,The bathroom was pretty tight for two people but that‚Äôs standard across Europe and it was made up by the spacious bedroom.,A/C shut off during the night and warmed up the room. Room was tiny for two ladies, but we managed.,Nothing the only thing that I would add would be a mini fridge either in the rooms or as an optional buy to keep drinks an snacks cool!,It was quite tight.

But was upgraded so didn‚Äôt complain,Small rooms,Really we have no complaints,The hotel has one elevator that holds 2-3 people- It moves super slow. The hotel also has a flowery, perfumed smell that for an asthmatic was at time difficult for breathing. Also, there is no AC, which was fine for us due to the colder June temperatures but glad it wasn‚Äôt hot! The breakfast is pricy for being just ok. There are better options nearby.,small & low elevator,The smell of the room wasn't perfect, the ""leather"" cover of the extra bed was smelling very bad but they immediately removed it. I didn't love the design style of the hotel, all dark and gold, but this is a matter of taste.,The room was comfortable though small with not much space around the bed. The bathroom was very clean but the proximity of the shower door to the toilet is awkward.,Only issue for me is storage, there is a fun theme with champagne cork shape side tables, but I am afraid these are very impractical with a small diameter of space on top to put your things.
The area they're in would be better used to have normal side tables with a lot more drawers. They could put shelves in the corners for extra space too. As no area for getting ready most of my stuff had to be kept on the floor which is a shame.,Only complaint was that there was no mini fridge in room,I would have preferred,Lack of the fridge or kettle in the room, only Nespresso coffee machine and one pod, paper cup and wooden stirrer. A lack of any spoon and a normal ceramic cup or mug no mention a tea bag or a bottle of water.
It‚Äôs a 4star hotel right?,I couldn‚Äôt get the coffee machine to work, which was disappointing.,Don't have anything to say here.,Room for 2 persons, was very small,There was a lot of noise during the night from other rooms which did wake us. Even though we had a lovely room upgrade, some of the facilities didn‚Äôt work. The jacuzzi bath, the coffee machine and the light up mirror didn‚Äôt work.,Small rooms,The breakfast buffet was, in my opinion too expensive 22‚Ç¨,Expensive but it was paris,The room is too small for 2 people, even for Paris standards. You don‚Äôt have space to walk with 2 people in the room neither open a small luggage.,The only thing I would complain of is that you should put a bidet in the bathrooms but it‚Äôs more of a cultural thing.
Also the breakfast maybe it should be more varied and with some more fruit and juices.,Nothing,Nothing,The room is very small but I believe that‚Äôs normal for Paris city centre.,The very small room,None,hotel was expensive but that's Paris for you,May be due an update in the next couple of years but looks fine for now,Room was very small, however we only stayed for one night so that didn‚Äôt really bother us.,Nothing.,Wish the elevator was large;
Whirl-pool bathtub in room was turned off so I couldn't use it,N/a,N/A,No dislikes,Very very small room,Room was smaller than anticipated but it was fine. Grateful we had a balcony,The only downside was the size of ‚Äòstandard‚Äô rooms. Fine for one night or person, but not for a couple multi-night stay.

There is also a convenience store across the street in case you do not want to pay for the items in the mini fridge (which include sodas, lemonade, wine, and champagne as well as snacks).

The staff were apologetic and kind. It was in no way their fault.,Bedroom had no outward facing window.
WC was separate from the bathroom.
Construction work outside was noisy,The only drawback in an otherwise perfect experience was the temperature control. I don't know if this applies to all rooms but in my case I couldn't really independently control the A/C in my room (even though it seemed like I could). Looks like the hotel has control. Also in my case, the a/c vents and filters were blocked, the room got hot, and it took much longer than I would expect to fix (but it was fixed eventually). Also I think the radiator might be turning itself on randomly, contributing to the heating issue. The staff did try to help the best they could and even offered to switch room at some point. I'd still book there again though. Easy.,Room was not ready at 3pm,Nothing!,The room was pretty tight,N/a,Room lightnings are not good.

No plug available next to the bed and next to a mirror (for both cell phone and hairdryer ),The walls in the bedrooms were very thin, kept awake with neighbours chatting and laughing until very late..
There wasn't mych room to put your clothes, could have done with a couple of drawers, had to live out of suitcase which wasn't too bad we were only there for 4 nights.,Noise from the street till fairly late because it's a large avenue and rooms are comfortable but quite small. Very narrow stairs and hallways and extremely tiny elevator!,We are in our 60‚Äôs but quite fit so climbed the four flights of stairs to our room rather than use the small and dated lift. Less fit or able people may find the small lift an issue.,All good,Not really a complaint, but just be aware that our experience was a very lively street scene on Saturday night, with lots of young people out late creating more noise than other nights.,the room is so small,Like many Paris Hotels, twin beds smaller than North American standard twin beds. Our room very small for two people and suitcases. Mixed fruit at breakfast would be a nice addition. Breakfast tables very small.,If you're looking for an upbeat, modern hotel, you're wrong here.

Great for my morning coffee!,Room was extremely tight, two of us could not walk past the bed or get dressed at the same time. We had a ‚ÄúSuperior‚Äù room which was adequate for our short stay but an extra few feet of space would‚Äôve been nice. We travel very light with back packs only so we don‚Äôt need or expect much but it would‚Äôve been nice to know the size / space upon booking to consider a larger room.

WC was separate from the bathroom.
Construction work outside was noisy,The only drawback in an otherwise perfect experience was the temperature control. I don't know if this applies to all rooms but in my case I couldn't really independently control the A/C in my room (even though it seemed like I could). Looks like the hotel has control. Also in my case, the a/c vents and filters were blocked, the room got hot, and it took much longer than I would expect to fix (but it was fixed eventually). Also I think the radiator might be turning itself on randomly, contributing to the heating issue. The staff did try to help the best they could and even offered to switch room at some point. I'd still book there again though. Easy.,Room was not ready at 3pm,Nothing!,The room was pretty tight,N/a,Room lightnings are not good.

By no means a reason to not stay here though.,The outlets only work with a specific type of universal converter; for Americans/non-European plugs, make sure to bring a few different types of converters b/c only one of ours fit into the plugs. This has not been my experience with other hotels in Europe. 
I also did not like that you have to leave your key at the front desk, instead of just giving you a key card like most hotels.

But what really stood out for us was the super helpful hotel staff Christelle.

There is also no air conditioning but we were comfortable with a fan and cracked windows on very hot summer nights.,We had to climb 5 flights of stairs to get to our room with heavy bags,Sometimes got a bit noisy, and hot so we had to use the fan,No elevator.,it is a bit noisy during night, but that's what you get from living in the very city center,6 floors up and no lift,No lift,I got a room at 6th floor and they don't have elevators. It was a pain to take the heavy luggage up by myself. Also for the luggage storage service, they didn't have lockers; instead, you would just put the luggage by the check-in desk and they would watch it.,There is some kind of pub on the ground floor opens till 2am, so it‚Äôs quite loud at night.,The pillow was just tiny. And there was just 1 towel.,Electricity supply broken once,No elevator, no tv in my room, no phone to call reception for assistance.,Not much I didn‚Äôt like this about it. Simple and clean room.,Rooms were a little small, but for a solo traveler I didn‚Äôt mind.,When I came to the hotel hot water was already not working. The staff did not notify me and till Sunday checkout I had to shower with cold water,it was very loud and would be happier with standard blankets. For light sleapers would recommend earplugs for noise.,stairs are really tiring me,There is no lift and no kettle in the room (but the stuff was very kind to make hot water at the reception),No elevator. WiFi wasn‚Äôt working. No TV in room.,I missed a TV to catch up with the news. I like to watch some local shows when traveling. And the wifi sucks üòñ,Stats and on the 5 th floor,no elevator but no problem with not too heavy and not too big luggage,Some staff members are not friendly. 
We could not check in at 12:00, only at 14:00. 
The bathroom was leaking.
The bathroom is very basic.,Be advised there is no elevator so if you have mobility problems or a lot of luggage it is a bit of a chore.,The stairs is the only minus. I was on the 6th floor so I had to walk up with my suitcase, which was quite hard but I do understand that this is a historical building. Also, for safety the reception asks you to leave the key when you go out, and they are immediately there when you come in. At first I thought it was a negative aspect of their policy but then I concluded that it is a good practice for safety there days.,Firstly there is no lift and no porter service, so we had a hard time carting our luggages up 3 floors! Made matters worse when the elder lady at the reception offered no help, nonchalantly gesticulated ""good for exercise"" as she spoke no English. (Note: we are seniors with heart and knees issues climbing narrow steps with heavy luggages just don't click). Then had to suffer very rude incident when the same lady refused to let me take the remaining luke warm water from the kettle - she SNATCHED the kettle back from me!!! And also chided us for not leaving the room keys behind. (Note: there is no kettle in each room only at the recept. The boiled water was left in kettle for more than 30 mins to cool - good enough to touch and fill in my plastic water bottle - so why such a rude refusal?. And I noticed that only 1 set of room keys were available for us and the cleaners for the room. As a hotel establishment shouldn't you have 2 sets - because chiding guests who ""don't comply with house rules"" does not cut it too.,Not having facilities to make a cup of tea in the room.,Really could do with a kettle and tea/coffee making and it would've been perfect.,No elevator and awkward stairs to reception on first floor and rooms on second floor and higher. Be aware if you are old or not agile and have heavy luggage. Fortunately we were given a room on the second floor and managed our luggage without assistance. No tea/coffee or electric jug in the room.,May not be satisfactory for a longer stay because it lacks a TV, mini fridge and coffee station. However for shorter stays it is wonderful.,No one is available until 15:00. A problem if you arrive earlier and want to leave luggage and explore the city,Bed was a single, so bigger would be a bit better.,No aircon and you could hear the people in the rooms ether side and above,If I‚Äôm being picky the pillows were flimsy and towels small.,I liked everything about it. If Air con had been available in 30c weather and a basic coffee maker for waking up I would've rated it a perfect 10.,Size,Bathroom was a bit squishy,Very steep staircase and no lift so be prepared, you may have to carry heavy luggage up multiple flights of stairs. There is no air-conditioning to cool down the rooms in summer, there is a fan.,No elevator. It was hard for me to pull my large suitcase up the stairs to the second floor. Going down was easier because there was a young man behind the desk, who is able to assist me.,No lift so carrying suitcases to 6th floor was exhausting,only for able bodied people. no elevator. had to wake up 6 flights of stairs.,The room was small (you won't spend much time there though), the small fan provided was not enough for the really hot days.,It didn‚Äôt have many amenities and I didn‚Äôt like that the room key had to be left with reception every time I left my room.,No elevator, steep staircase.,had to hand in key to reception every time we left,As advertised, there was no lift. The stairs were a bit tricky with a heavy suitcase, but you do only have to lug it up and down once. Also, the only aircon available was a small plug-in fan, which wasn‚Äôt ideal, but you could open up the windows wide to let the breeze in. Some bathroom amenities were lacking, would have liked a smaller towel for my hands/face.,The stairs ü§™,the stairs to the top floor but it was worth it for the balcony,No elevator but no real problem.","The location of the hotel is very near to the metro and a walking distance to tourist spots.

It is steep climb up stairs to get to the apartment, be aware of that if you have any accessibility issues,Taxi to airport (arranged by the hotel) was more expensive than we were quoted.,Nothing,The air conditioning system was set up so that it could only cool until November, when it switched to only heating. We were there at the end of October and could only keep the room warm by turning the AC off, which made the room a little stuffy.,Should have chosen bigger room.
Would definitely stay here again.
Artsy area.Loved it,The lower level where the gym and sauna are is a bit congested. But it was lovely to relax in the sauna at the end of a full day of activities.

Stay is okay, but I would recommend that you go and grab yourself a nice breakfast at that price outside of the restaurant.,The room was not perfectly clean and there was no watercooker or writing paper (although there was a pencil...). That would have made it perfect.,Breakfast very basic,Nothing!,We couldn't stay longer.,Nothing,Rooms are on the small side. A/C would automatically shut off at night and I would need to restart it multiple times a night to keep the room cool.,No restaurant,Nothing,Nothing.,I knocked a point off due to the fact that the walls are thin. On our first night, the residents (about x4 18 -20 year old boys) upstairs made a lot of noise and, for some reason, woke up at 4:30am to shout make noise and sunbathe on their balcony.

To be fair, when I asked them to be quiet because we were 'dormire', they apologised and were quiet after that. It may have been a one-off, and I think it was their last day, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt!

However, as mentioned, the walls are thin, but as stated in the apartment detail, it is quiet time between 11pm-7am, so we didn't experience any loud noise between these times. 

I think it should be stated when communicating to new people when the apartment is booked that quiet time should be respected as a reminder.

This was the only blip in an otherwise fantastic apartment and location. Don't let this put you off. Book now!,Nothing.,Too expensive and breakfast wasn‚Äôt included,small elevator but that is Paris,-,There was nothing to dislike,I don't think there was anything we didn't like!,Our room looked out on a patio and I'm afraid we disturbed the neighbors coming home late one night when we opened the windows for some fresh cool air.,The fridge didn‚Äôt work but we were able to put our drinks in the reception fridge so it wasn‚Äôt really a problem.,The twin beds don‚Äôt separate so that was kind of disappointing. The breakfast is not worth 18 dollars.,If I had to think of a negative, the only thing, which was very minor was that the air conditioning seemed to switch off on its own throughout the night, and it was really hot during our visit, however, that could just be us not working it correctly. Really very minor!,We drank bottle of champagne in the room and next day than the room was cleand they left empty bottle two days near the door.

Riccardo was lovely, and he contacted us every day to make sure we were ok and had everything we needed. Great communication and attention to detail. Thanks for the wine!

We loved it and the location. It is about a 10-15 minute walk to the town centre (depending on how fast you walk). There is a supermarket not too far from the apartment (near the Teatro Nazarena, where we watched an Italian opera). A few minutes from here is the town centre. You can never get lost. Just go through the 2 beautiful wall arches, and you're then on your way back home.

There is a hill you have to walk up as soon as you leave the apartment that takes a few minutes, but it meant that we got our exercise! The rest of the walk is more or less straight, and coming back, it is downhill. However, if you do struggle with mobility, then this hill may take it out of you.

Relatively expensive.
Crowded bathroom.,The breakfast should have been good. It‚Äôs a nice set up. But it was spoiled by having no toaster during the 4 nights of my stay. So it was scrambled egg on bread each morning. The last morning the egg was cold like it had just come out of a cooler. When I politely mentioned to the lady, she didn‚Äôt seem interested.

The staff at the breakfast wasn‚Äôt very friendly.,Should have a blanket in the room because AC is centralized and can go really low.

We were at fault, but perhaps a more friendly tone would have been more appropriate!,none,The room should have come with free breakfast and swimming pool and Sauna.,The refrigerator was not working in the room. No storage for beverage, no milk for coffee and no complementary bottle of water.,It's just a little bit off from the city center but other than that, everything was top notch.,still, didnt got my deposit,Not much. The wine fridge was not operating and normal fridge set at a too warm temperature. It could not be be altered to a cooler temperature. 
A little isolated for choice of bats and restaurants. Metro stations north and south about 12 min walk.,The breakfast need a significant improvement. Few choice (jar of jam in common with other guests, not single portion, few sweet choice, no sliced cheese, sometimes lack of stuff) and poor customer care (not complete set up of the table, with missing of spoon or knife). Waitress should pay more attention to the room and the table to forcast what is missing or is in shortage (e.g. the silced bread),cant complain","We really liked the room, it was clean a comfortable. Location was excellent. We liked that it was away from the tourist district, so you really get a feel of living in Paris for the duration of the stay. Price is excellent compared to other hotels in Paris since it's away from tourist areas. We used the metro to get around.,Close to the venue of my conference, walking distance from metro station, very comfortable.,The hotel is really great. It's near bus and metro station and not too far from center. The hotel itself is cool, great breakfast, staff and the possibility to refill water as many times as you like.

Breakfast was quite rich in options, I guess anyone can find something for themselves - there was even a waffle station. 
Hotel staff recommended me some restaurants in close vicinity to the hotel, and those were very tasty recommendations ;) 
I guess the hotel is located at some distance to the main attractions in Paris, but it is close to public transport, and it is walkable distance to Luxembourg palace and Bon Marche. 
With public transport it took me around 40 min to the Orly airport.,Excellent hotel and worker‚Äôs,really nice room.

Staff were super friendly and area was really good. Used the local bakeries and they were delicious. Also the restaurant across the road was fab, really friendly staff.,- Location : Close to major bus stops, Metro a bit far to walk, but it is reachable by bus. The area is middle class Urban, felt completely safe at all times, and there was a permanent Police patrol stationed next to the Hotel.

- Cleanliness: Everything was absolutely perfect. 

- Room: Spacious room, great Bathroom, but no interesting view. But fine for a city hotel.

- Breakfast: Excellent, pastries and fresh juice at will

- Swimming Pool: A bit tannoying that we had to reserve, and for a limited time (45m), but the hotel staff was very accommodating to find hours that were appropriate for us. 

As far as I understand, the rules are imposed by the French Government. The pool and sauna were clean and well maintain.

- Staff: Almost every person was polite and helpful, with one very minor exception (see negatives).

"4 Avenue Ren√© Coty, 14th arr., 75014 Paris, France",H√¥tel Du Midi Paris Montparnasse,"everything was good,There was a baln√©o in the bathroom, and we tried to use it, but it did not work... rather than that, everything was great!,Noise from the floor above. Take earplugs. There is a cupboard by reception where you can leave luggage,Luggage storage was a closet grouped along with everyone else's stuff and while secure from outsiders was not secure if other hotel guests had wandering fingers so be careful what you leave behind. Would have liked a little more interaction with recommendations from front staff and a microwave would also be nice but appears not to be a thing in Paris hotels. Breakfast needed 24 hr advance notice.,Rooms are quite outdated, particularly the bathroom fittings. There was mold in the grout of the tiles of the shower. Sound insulation from hallway could be better.,I am gluten free and there were no options so I paid for something I could not eat. It would be nice to have coffee in the lobby and a bigger cup/glass in the room.,Difficult to climb into a bath tub with arthritis.,Bathroom a bit out of date,There was a short passage between the outside door to a second door that you had to pass to get into the room. I don't know why this exists as it really just made it so you had to hold two doors open for everyone to get through to the bedroom. Perhaps it's a fire code? The one time it came in use was when one person was showering and another needed to change clothes. So, that person went into the passage area for privacy. But I'm pretty sure that's not why it's there. No screens on the windows, but, apparently, that's not a European thing.,Bathroom was clean but could have used some minor maintenance on the ceiling.,Cost performance,Paintwork and carpeting are showing signs of age but everywhere is clean,We were not made to feel welcome when we checked in. The staff member on reception was very rude unfortunately. Other than this there were no negatives!,Nothing to mention,A bit outdated.,Not happy there was no leeway for 2pm checkin when it was cold and rainy outside.,Jacuzzi in the room doesn't work past 10pm.

35 euros per night for the parking: it would have been nice to have been given a code to enter rather than have to pick up the parking fob and return to front desk every time to open/close garage doors.,I didn‚Äôt like that you have to pay parking it should be included with your reservation. And the parking fee per day is expensive. I didn‚Äôt like that I was not told there was a daily fee.,nothing at ll was bad to be honest,Hotel is outdated.,The rooms were far too hot. Sweltering. There was no way to cool it down. Could open window but then too noisy.,It's about a 30 min walk. from the main attractions
Be on time if you want to order breakfast the next morning.,Single room, is super small. Little space for luggage.,- room rather small
- bathroom also small and with a step to get to it,There was nothing we did not like.,The carpet in the room,Everything staff friendly,Not much.,location and staff,N/A,The walls are light you can hear the neighbors,The triple room was extremely small and cramped. It‚Äôs a room that would be cramped with just one queen bed inside and instead it has a queen AND a double. Frankly this should not be a triple room at all. From the pictures attached to the specific room type it was unclear which layout exactly you‚Äôre going to get. The pictures showed a more spacious triple room, so it is somewhat deceiving.,Some front desk staff were not that friendly.,Nothing,There was nothing we didn't like,There was works in room next door so sleeping during day was not possible :) But night was quiet
There is no option for coffee with breakfast (you get only coffee with milk),Nowadays an additional outlet would be nice, to charge the phone.,Nil,Missed having a fridge,Not much.,Clean, kind staff. Rooms were good size,My room was au premier √©tage facing the street. While the double windows kept the sound low, I would have appreciated privacy curtains. I wanted the light but not give a show!,view of back alley,bathroom could have benefited form some upgrades.,Small room size. Breakfast could be more than simple rolls and coffee/juice & yogurts.,No sockets near bed or desk
Staff not very friendly,Check in the first impression and when you have a clerk that is salty and unhappy and short with you it just sets a tone for our stay. It was hard to overcome the treatment we rec'd at check in but luckily we never saw this person again so that helped a lot. The gal that checked us in is in the wrong profession.,No coffee, the double room too small for 2 adults,No place to park to load baggage.,some night I could smell cigarette smoke, but it‚Äôs France, I can‚Äôt complain.,Some noise from other rooms.,Lack of BBC news channel,None,Front door was locked when I tried to get in after midnight and my room key didn‚Äôt work on the outside access pad. Needed someone to unlock the door for me.,We had a 3.5 year old with us, but they made us pay for his breakfast. 3.5 year-olds eat like, maybe a bite of croissant and a spoonful of yogurt. I wish they had let us share, because that felt like a huge waste of money and food (even though it‚Äôs not terribly expensive).","Very nice location and pretty view from our room,The room was very clean, the location was amazing, and the staff were super friendly. The wifi also worked very well and we had a very good connection. We had a really great experience there!,Location, we went for the catacombs.

I loved the location and how caring the staff are.,Staff were very friendly and accommodating. Room was lovely and clean.,Location. Walk across the road to the catacombs . Also walk across the road to the train station for Charles de Galle airport,Nice to be able to sleep with an open window and not been bothering by traffic noise.,The room was quiet at the back of the building and the bed comfortable,The location was great. Very convenient to get on the RER and Metro or take a bus. We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel, but there are plenty of nearby bakery options for wonderful pain au chocolat or croissants. There are multiple restaurants nearby ranging from low price to medium price. Even a McDonalds around the corner if you must have that. The beds/furniture in the room was pretty tight for the three of us staying in a Queen/Twin combo room but it didn't feel cramped, just made good use of the space considering how much furniture was there (two beds, two side tables, one long desk/table under the TV, large closet. The bathroom and shower were roomy. The beds were comfortable with plenty of pillows, the room was nice and clean, and they had the European style windows that open horizontally like shutters or open top/down. Even though there was a restaurant/bar downstairs where people frequently smoked, we never smelled a hint of smoke from our room on the second floor. We watched France in a Euro Cup game on our TV and the crowd at the bar downstairs was apparently about 15 seconds behind as we would see the action and shortly later would hear the crowd react. Gave us a glimpse of the passion the French have for futbol.,The area was convenient to transportation and had various restaurants and food options. Room was cleaned well daily.,Location,Convenient location and welcoming staff. Allowed us to store our luggage when we arrived very early. Also got a room with a surprisingly large bathroom complete with a tub,The location is a 10. Opposite Denfert Rochereau metro and RER station gives direct links to;

Also if using Eurostar from Gare du Nore. Also easy access to lots of good eating places and downtown Paris. We had a very nice room on level 6. Was quiet and comfortable with quite a classy feel. Would recommend.,Junior suite room excellent value for money, good location. Parking on site.

Comfy extra large bed, excellent pillows (this is important!), good staff.,The breakfast croissants and buns are exceptionally tasty! Together with the 30-second-walk to the Metro/RER station, this is my hotel-of-choice in Paris.

large windows with great view,This place worked well for us (after a negative check in). The room size is bigger than most in Paris. The room was furnished nice enough and it was quiet at night. The elevator worked well, responsive. Hotel location next to blue line was important to us and it worked very well, just a few minutes from the station.,Very good location. It is next to Denfert station. Many restaurants near to the hotel.,the room was not the same as in the photos when I booked. it was smaller and with no space for suitcases like in the photos. The lady at the front desk told is we could cancel the rest of our itinerary if we gave 3 days notice. We decided to stay as it was a hassle to get a refund for the remainder days. The beds are very comfortable, they clean every day and the staff is very polite so we stayed. The location is great.,Large room located near RER stop, catacombs, and Liberation Museum. very helpful staff sores our luggage before and after our stay.,excellent location. easy access to the airport.,Staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful, particularly with respect to handling of luggage. Excellent location, in an area with good restaurants and good public transportation. It met or exceeded our expectations for a 3* hotel in Paris,I‚Äôm from the US and stayed 5 nights in April. The location was excellent, very close to a Metro and to a light rail station. In addition, the street behind the hotel had many fruit, vegetable, bread and meat shops.

"70 Bis, Boulevard Ornano, 18th arr., 75018 Paris, France",ibis Paris Ornano Montmartre Nord 18√®me,"Nothing,Not much to criticise at all - perhaps a kettle/the chance to have a hot drink in the room would've added some extra comfort.,N/a,It would be great if there was a bin both in the toilet and in the main living space. Apart from that it was great.,Room service didn‚Äôt work , Tv remote was faulty,English of the receptionists should be better in a primarily touristic hotel. The vicinity of the hotel seems not very safe at night but we had no problems.,Breakfast was not great. But it was okey,Rooms little,The price didn't reflect how far out of the city it was. The neighbourhood was quite rough, we didn't feel safe to walk outside at night.,The area. If you turn left out of the hotel and walk 5-10 mins towards the Sacre Coeur, it's becomes lovely and just like the 'Paris' or 'France' you picture... if you turn right it is like the ghetto, with pick pockets and rough people. You need to be very careful with your bags and personal belongings.,Breakfast area is currently under construction and builders were using the facilities so often there was no coffee left in machine. Not enough seating, no matter what time we chose we had to wait ot share a table.,Breakfast could have been better. Felt quite limited option wise,It was pretty basic and some facilities could do with refurbishment,Only a small comment, but the carpets on the stairs were very dirty.,Small rooms and shower,Not a great Area we were a bit intimidated by,Lady receptionist is good , staff good Better if washroom was big enough and atleast kettle in a room which is advertised on site . Rest everything is good,The bathroom was very small. I stayed for a night. Next day morning I slept in a bit late as I had a long journey ahead of me. I heard so much noise of someone cleaning constantly that I couldn't sleep. There was literally zero sound control. Based on this, I am guessing if someone had the tv on next door, it would be equivalent to me watching tv.,The breakfast was the same for every morning,without fruits or veggies,most of the vessel was dirty as unwashed,very small place for eating,tables near toilet.In the room,the floor was not cleaned daily.,The room was very very small. The cleaning personnel cane everyday, and took the used towels but didn‚Äôt gave new ones to replace, after asking for it they gave it tho.,Room was quite small
A bit of a rough location,Room was quite small,Cramped bathroom,The horrible area and room could be cleaner.,A little cramped but after all, this is Paris so it was to be expected.,Room was small,Price was bit high,The area that this hotel is in is not safe. Constant police presence in the area, a lot of undesirables.,Rooms were Small / compact. And Area a bit busier than we expected.,Location quite far from Monmarte and in not such a nice area.,The room we stayed in has got one of the smallest bathrooms I've ever been to, and I've been through several.
STAY away from any room that is numbered 1; i.e 101 201 501...etc. Unless you want to hug the shower while you are using the toilet or water the floor while using the sink.

The staff are not helpful, though they were nice; i.e. not rude. But unhelpful. They are way more strict in the check-in and check-out times that any other ibis hotels in Paris or others in Europe. And for sure even more than other 2 or 3 star hotels that I've been through across Europe. And they are not that full to begin with.

There was no enough room or silverware or plates to accommodate the residences during breakfast.

The location itself not close to attractions, yet not far. The neighborhood is a ""getto"" neighborhood, for a lack of better word, but that may not be an issue in itself but FYI.

It was around 10 euros difference in terms of price than other ibis hotels in Paris, definitely not worth the decreased price.,Bathroom should have a division between the shower and the toilet, all the time we try to take a bath it was very difficult because the water was splitting all over the floor, and it was impossible to enter to the bathroom without shoes. Also, neighborhood where hotel is located is not safer after certain hours, it should be considered if you like to arrive late at night. And to finalize, breakfast is very simple, it should have more variety.,Room need to be little bigger,Although is 2 min walking to a metro station that takes you everywhere, it didn‚Äôt feel the safest place at night and early morning. Especially for a solo female traveler. Price was a bit too much considering what I mention above, but I get that you‚Äôre paying fir the closeness to metro station. 
Reception staff speak poorly or none English. It was hard communicating and requesting something with some of them. I personally think that every hotel should hire bilingual people for improving hotel service to guests. 12 euros for the breakfast they serve, I think it‚Äôs a little too much. Might be 10 or even 8.,Room was very small compared to ones shown in photos. Breakfast was quite poor.,The breakfast had nice food but was not well organized.,The rooms were quite warm for us. We could not really adjust the temperature so we slept we the windows open (which was fine for us but could be an issue for somebody else).,Everything was fine. I have no complaints!,Nothing comes to mind.,There was a problem with the sink but it was fast repaired. The toilet seat was weirdly position, so close and face to the wall, it was not easy for a short person so i cant imagine for a tall person. You might see 1-2 homeless people near the hotel and drunk people late at night.,small room,Breakfast was very minimal,Breakfast was OK (quality and variety) but one has to ask the personnel when something is finished.,no issues,The neighborhood is not the nicest,The breakfast was disappointing. For two days, the coffee machine did not work. It seems that this is a recurrent problem. The ventilation system in the accommodation was too noisy, so we shut it down. It was warm, so we left the door of the balcony open, despite the noise from street.,Breakfast is not available until the proposed time. And when you ask for it, they will answer stating ""stock not available"". Service is not extrememy good. Better book for option without breakfast.,There were some cleanliness issues that I guess just don't get considered - like cobwebs and dirty skirting boards. My room looked out on the courtyard (which is not as grand as the description makes out) and it meant that when teenagers were staying and decided to shout across the rooms, it echoed. This wasn't helpful to me having come to run the Paris Marathon. Though the description says ""soundproof"", I think this relates to just elements of the room. Even with the windows shut, I could hear the courtyard, and all walking/conversation in the corridor was heard loudly, and doors banged shaking the room. I had chosen a hotel as it would be less disruptive than a hostel, but clearly there are issues with it being an old building. Also would have appreciated a kettle, but that's how they make additional money right.,Breakfast is very limited...,See above,Small rooms, but larger than others in the area.,Breakfast was from 6-10am. Me & friends arrived at 9am but as hotel was full there was nothing left. Had to wait 20 mins to get more food, plates, cutlery etc. Area does not look safe at night.,Small room no kettle available when we asked they told us to go down reception and get,Some of the staff were very friendly and polite, others were not. Not the tidiest and the towels smelt like they were burnt,Mattress is not that good.,The room is really really small and not clean. The towels were not clean and the bathroom either. The staff was not really nice.,Room size is small,The mattress was covered in plastic, and I think I must have tossed and turned a lot in my sleep as I'd managed to move the sheet away from the mattress and woke up stuck to the plastic.,I have no complaints. I do personally prefer a larger room but you pay for what you get.","The location and no nonsense facilities were the best we stayed in in Europe,Really clean room and the wider hotel seemed clean and fresh too. Comfy bed, easy and swift check in.

Relatively expensive.
Crowded bathroom.,The breakfast should have been good. It‚Äôs a nice set up. But it was spoiled by having no toaster during the 4 nights of my stay. So it was scrambled egg on bread each morning.

A little isolated for choice of bats and restaurants. Metro stations north and south about 12 min walk.,The breakfast need a significant improvement. Few choice (jar of jam in common with other guests, not single portion, few sweet choice, no sliced cheese, sometimes lack of stuff) and poor customer care (not complete set up of the table, with missing of spoon or knife). Waitress should pay more attention to the room and the table to forcast what is missing or is in shortage (e.g. the silced bread),cant complain","We really liked the room, it was clean a comfortable.

This made the feel of the room a bit gloomy.,Booked double bed but received two pushed together.Booked parking space for ‚Ç¨29 a night,on arrival someone placed his car between the lines and my car did not fit in to the last space.Was offered another space in different level at the exit with such a narrow and sharp entrance where scratched my car in a wall.Wanted to have bath wasn‚Äôt enough hot water for half bath.Was waiting for 2-3 hours to have hot water again.,We had a limited amount of hot water and no one advised us so the water got cold when we were showering. We also booked a room with a garden view and did not get it. The staff very kindly offered to change but we had already unpacked all of our stuff.,Refills of coffee and tea making needed and also shower gel,Unfortunately my room was right near the elevator ~ which was quite noisy. Being a light sleeper I was woken to the doors opening and closing & the creaking noise it made when used through the night.,No complaints,Cost,Not much to say,It would have been better if there was a facecloth. The stairs and building was a little confusing to navigate.,Nothing to mention.,Possibly too may steps out of reception, it didn't affect us, but might be a problem for less able guests (or was there a lift we missed?),Housekeeping was slightly odd. You go out for the day and the housekeepers come in and clean/tidy your room. Room was well cleaned, beds made, however we had 2 bins in our room and sometimes only one bin would be emptied while the other bin had rubbish still in it. Changed our pillows for whatever reason. Dressing gown provided were used by myself and I would semi fold it or leave it over something and it would get moved into the pile of clothes and just left. Other things like that. It was odd,The bus trip (Route 351) from CDG to the hotel was horrendous. Train was easy with the hotel being a short walk from Nation station which serves one regional line and four metro lines.,A little more equipment in the kitchen would have been helpful,Underneath the bed hadn't been cleaned recently.,Window without a view but we didn't stay in our hotel room looking out the window.,The rooms are a bit impersonal but maybe others prefer them that way. A bit on the pricy side but normal for this area in Paris.,the fact that I could talk to the next room through the walls‚Ä¶,no bowls in the kitchenette or dishwashing detergent,A hotel needs to respect the patrons and should not take chances by allocating unused and dirty rooms to patrons. The breakfast is not value for money,The underground car park is impossibly tight. I scratched my wheels going in and going out. I strongly recommend parking on the street instead (there were available spaces when we were there).,Our room location!!! We were the last door before you went out into the courtyard. All the lobby noise and door to courtyard at all hours. Rather annoying.,We had the identical breakfast for all 8 mornings,a little too far from sights we wanted to see,they can add a small bench in the small garden.
clean up the stairs and vacuum better.,Breakfast could be better, because during my visit it was a very average spread of ready-to-eat stuff with a little portion of egg & meat. Would be great if they can add more directions for reaching the rooms - because it was so confusing.,Room was a bit on the small side but in Paris it is to be expected.,The lighting in the room is a bit dim. The drain lever is hard to press.,The hotel rooms are a bit old.,On day the cleaners left our door open with the key in the door. We were out all day & was really disappointed. We could have lost a lot of personal items.,Room too small for comfort. Staff didn't assist with advice or recommendations but were polite.,The rooms are ok but could do with upgrading soon
You can get a better breakfast along the street for less","Comfortable bed, clean, nice staff. 
Also a good breakfast,location, rooms, the beds and shower,I liked the neighborhood, the close proximity to public transportation (bus and metro stations), and the design of the hotel.,Great location - walking distance from Paris centre but the metro was 5 minutes away.

Gorgeous garden,really nice breakfast. Hotel well connected to the metro, very near Nation. Staff were great and the room was a cosy, clean and the AC was a life saver in the summer. Hob and cooking area in room. Upgrade room due to avalibility too. Will for sure consider here again for future trips.,The small kitchen area was excellent with induction cooker, microwave, fridge, plates & cutlery, kettle, etc. Bed comfortable, nice windows opening out onto courtyard, very clean and receptionist who checked us in very friendly & helpful.

Lovely outdoor garden area to sit in and relax. Has everything you need and have enjoyed my stay.,Location is great. Easy access to metro and a pleasant walk to the Seine.

Breakfast is very good.,Lovely garden, 24hr checkin, helpful staff, breakfast, good beds,The staff was lovely and very accommodating. Since they had availability- they graciously allowed us to check in early. Bag storage facilities are also available. Metro is just a 5 minute walk - with connections to all the tourist attractions. Room itself was clean and we loved the charming decor and layout!,I liked that it was farther out from the crowded tourist areas, it had a well equipped kitchenette, it was clean, and had a cute little outside patio area. It was quite easy to get to via metro from CDG.,Very friendly and helpful reception staff, clean, comfortable rooms. Strong AC -required in the heatwave.,The staff were very polite and professional. The hotel has a lovely quirky layout, lots of courtyards, so it appealed to the eclectic in me. The room was clean, airy, and spacious, with a good fridge, a microwave and a sink. The bathroom had a very powerful and hot shower, always a good sign, and most of all, the air conditioning was exceptional, a god send in Paris in August. We will stay again.,Very beautiful hotel with cozy gardens and clean comfortable rooms. 
The stuff was really polite and helpfull.
The location was also very convinient with metro and bus stations in very short walking distance from the hotel.,Great metro access to different locations in Paris. Friendly staff very affable and communication was lovely.,Totally comfortable place in a nice bit of Paris.,Gorgeous garden courtyard, friendly hotel reception, comfortable double room with kitchenette, solid breakfast, and the bathtub... c'est parfait!,The staff were very friendly. I had specifically requested a quiet room and I was upgraded to a larger room overlooking the courtyard. It was very quiet through the night and overall a very pleasant stay.,Staff. Patio garden. Location. Local restaurant next door.,The room was comfortable and had a little inbuilt kitchen with supplies, and the staff were exceptionally helpful in making sure I and my daughter had a safe and pleasant visit to Paris.,A little off the tourist path but a wonderful hotel. Everyone was friendly and were fluent in English. They had me down as American as soon as I said Bonjour! That made me smile to know we were welcomed. We welked to a wonderful Street Market around the corner that was amazing and enjoyed our walk to all the sites. We could have taken the metro or taxi but walking was wonderful. Why I chose here was because I used the parking garage. It is very small but once the car was parked we did not start it up until it was time to leave. Will stay here again the next time in Paris!,value for money and lots of amenities nearby including Nation metro,I loved the comfy room and the courtyards are beautiful! The big bath was also wonderful. Overall a very peaceful, restorative stay.,a nice little oasis in busy Paris,comfortable, relaxed atmosphere,I liked that after complaining about the original room which was in an unwelcoming state, the receptionist offered an alternative room,Lovely staff at check-in and check-out. The room was a nice size (certainly for Parisian standard). Great location, close to Metro and RER.,Separate room for children with bunkbed. Everything we wanted to was walking distance or a quick hope on subway.,I have to say that we could here the person in the next room but maybe that says more about them being noisy. Otherwise, great stay.,very clean,Hotel was easy to find but rooms are quietly located in a courtyard. Great to have interconnecting rooms with our children. Good clean bathrooms and super comfy beds.,clean and quiet,very friendly and efficient staff. they were so nice to accept to check us in 2 hours in advance because the rooms were ready.

"122 Rue Saint Denis, 2nd arr., 75002 Paris, France",SERENERS Apartments in Montorgueil - Rue Saint-Denis,"WIFI coverage could be better.,Wi-Fi didn't work perfectly. Some messengers weren't available through the Wi-Fi,We stayed in the building past the courtyard which didn‚Äôt have a lift and we were on the third floor. The stairs were very narrow which made it difficult with our luggage, however the first building did have a lift so I would request to stay here instead.,There were too many emails connected to the stay. I counted more than 25 - which is really excessive for a regular booking.,The sofa was so uncomfortable that you almost couldn‚Äôt sit in it without hurting your back. The wifi for our floor didn‚Äôt work at all, fortunately we piggybacked off wifi from another floor but the signal was weak. Cell phone signal strength very low at only 1-bar. The apartment was missing even the most basic supplies, no salt, pepper, teabags, sugar, vinegar and oil etc. otherwise kitchen had basic dishes required.,The WiFi connection was terrible. They hot water for the shower ran out too soon and they only gave a tiny little tube that was a multipurpose shower/shampoo gel,I couldn't get cell reception, but that could be a google fi issue. However, wi-fi connection was close to zero.,The washer/dryer was not user friendly and made heavy noise and shook violently.,WiFi didn't work, but we didn't need it.,One of the lamps was placed really low, and I kept hitting it with my head, very annoying.,The lift can only carry one person at a time but better than not having a lift at all to the 4th floor. I would suggest to have air conditioning in the unit (bedroom and living room) as it gets very warm during the summer although a fan was provided when we requested for it on day one. Toiletries can also be improved to better quality ones. Also, the bathroom needs hooks so you can hang towels/clothes and a rack for toiletries inside the shower area. The drain in the shower also became slow on our day 3. The wifi network wasn't working during our whole stay, I have raised the issue to them but no solution was given until we checked out. You can connect to their available networks but there is no internet at all.,We couldn‚Äôt find pots or pans if we wanted to cook a meal . Plenty of cutlery and crockery tho. We just enjoyed eating out!,The staff provided the details of how to get into the house before my arrival. However, they forgot to give me the passcode of the second door of the building. We texted them but no reply. Finally, I borrowed a phone from a restaurant and called them to get the passcode. We had waited for more than one hour. 
There was a small new lift for carrying luggages but it was still not in service. We had to carry 4 suitcases to the fifth floor and the staircases were very steep.,The instructions to enter the apartment were somewhat confusing and incomplete‚Äîhad to call to get one of the codes. The motion sensor light in the courtyard was very bright at night.,Bed area is tight when sofa bed folded out. Very comfortable though!,Some kitchen appliances didn‚Äôt work. And the kitchen had some leaking problem. Although amended immediately still affected the pleasantries of staying there in the beginning.,It was pretty noisy on the Saturday night from the bar below but fine noise wise the other nights we stayed. The Wifi was also a bit intermittent.,- the wifi rarely worked 
- be aware the lift is very small- you have to send one suitcase up at a time (without you) and even a travel pram must be folded up.,Small spot of area not cleaned properly, however, the online host organized another cleaning for me. They responded back to me during weekend which was good experience. If you are living at building B then you better have a strong body to carry baggage upstairs by hand. We had 2 pieces of 23kg luggage and the stair was so narrow. It took me lot of time to move luggage up to 4th floor.. Almost dead.,slight smell in bathroom and fan noise at night, but not a big deal. entry is a bit complicated with four codes to get through,Had very bad experience in checking in as the code provided for the lockbox was wrong and I want able to get the key and stayed outside for hours trying to call someone to give me the correct code. After this when I asked these hours to be added to extend my check out time , the answer was ‚Äúsorry we can‚Äôt accommodate your request ‚Äú. What a joke! But you can send me the wrong code so I won‚Äôt be able to check in!!,The WiFi didn't exist, there was no WiFi.
The apartment had very little furniture, it felt sparse.
This is the first time ever with booking.com that I've had to secure a ‚Ç¨500 deposit, would it not be better to check my rating.
The booking was just a hassle, message after message... Pay the deposit, reminder pay the deposit, what time will you arrive and to top it all they asked for a departure time before we arrived. Personally I found this booking stressful,Absence de lave-vaiselle,Ich fand die Sache mit dem safety deposit etwas nervig, man muss seine Kreditkarte hinterlegen und einem Sicherheitsdeposit von 500 Euro zustimmen, das aber nur abgebucht w√ºrde, wenn man die Wohnung verw√ºstet oder so.

Non chiaro lo sblocco del deposito cauzionale (non √® mai arrivata la mail di sblocco).,El ascensor no funcion√≥ durante los dos primeros d√≠as, porque lo hab√≠an pintado. Al tercer d√≠a volvi√≥ al servicio. Es un ascensor peque√±o, hay que subir de uno en uno, s√≥lo hay que tener paciencia. Pero las instalaciones est√°n nuevas.

Parkhaus direkt gegen√ºber ist sehr gut gelegen, aber schlecht bewertet. Wir haben direkt am Centre Pompidou geparkt und sind 8 Minuten gelaufen.,Leider wurde der Aufzug gerade renoviert und die Wohnung war im 4. Stock.

"29 Rue Gay-Lussac, 5th arr., 75005 Paris, France",Les Rives Oceanik,"We had a little bit of trouble with the AC. If we wanted it lower than 22 degrees we had to ask the front desk to lower it and it reset each day.,Nothing everything was great,Nothing at all,Small lobby (but the rest makes up for it!),breakfast was served in a very tight place at the reception area. You had to ""fight"" for space behind the table. Coffee machine was malfunctioning all the time.,Breakfast area particularly busy at 9am. Recommend coming early, late, or having breakfast in room.,Little space to unpack clothes,Not a lot of hanging space as there is no closet, per se, but not an issue for us with just 4 night stay. You can option to take breakfast in your room but there was only 1 chair and a little puff stool.,Only negative was the smell from the shower in the bathroom. I expect there are many sewage problems around Paris, but we had to keep the bathroom door closed to stop the smell entering the full suite.,Room felt much smaller than it was made to look on images, and there wasn't access to bottled water or similar.,Nothing,Nothing to mention.,The shower had an open stall which made it tough to shower without getting the entire bathroom wet.,Had an issue with one of the temporary (I think) night staff who was very rude when I asked for towels and I reported it for the hotel to deal with and improve on. Too bad because the rest of the staff were very, very pleasant and customer-oriented. Had a slow drain in one of the bathroom sinks which didn't really get fixed until we left. They tried but it didn't quite get fixed.,No, 100% perfect.,Nothing!

Very minor complaint.,None.,Nothing. It was a great hotel.,I'm not sure there was anything we didn't like! I'd say the only tiny detail was our shower tray In the bathroom seemed to not be fit very well causing it to squeak and water leaked over the side quite a bit so we had to put a towel down. But that detail is so small when everything else was perfect!,NIL,The rooms were a bit small for our family‚Äîprobably better suited for couples,The key room was not working properly
The safe was not working but it was repaired sweefly 
The shower glass was not big enough so the floor got wet easily,There were construction works next door so sometime the drilling noise was uncomfortable. But this is temporary for the time I stayed at the hotel.,There was noise pollution from the construction site nearby but it didn‚Äôt bother us much as it didn‚Äôt start until 9am and we were already up by then,Metro connections to the city center are not great.,It would be even better if could proactively provide disposable slippers and toothpaste.","Every single thing about this hotel was exceptional. You could smell how clean and new it was walking through the halls. The room was spotless and extremely comfortable.

The neighboring streets have lots of ethnic and French restaurants and Pantheon and Luxembourg Gardens are just few minutes walk away. There's a bus stop in front and saw that these buses go to Louvre, and other tourist sites so riding regular city bus would be cheap way to get around.

The next day, hot water was running back again.,the bath tub had the stopper missing but Patricia was kind enough to help solve for it.

charging points around the bed side would be ideal,Cleaning person came in long before checkout and without knocking - a nightmare,N / A,Hope to have more varieties in breakfast.,Breakfast was same everyday for 3 week, may be can add more menu, or some other cuisines. Besides, the fire alarm in room easily get when we use the kitchenette.,Price was a bit expensive, but not unreasonable for the room, breakfast and service,Room was small, we didn‚Äôt mind but some customers may want more space.,The main door is open all day even during the night, dangerous for anyone coming inside.,Well, the house keeping staff, especially the men can do more in making guests feel at home.

Cooked breakfast good but exactly the same every day.,The breakfast was continental, nice but relative simple, there were no any vegetables.,Nothings,It was very noisey with noise from the street and noise from the neighboring rooms. We could hear everything. Conversations, snoring, showering, footsteps of the other guests and it made it very hard to sleep. Also, it would be helpful to have a kitchen towel as we needed to keep buying paper towels for doing the dishes and cleaning the area etc. The ¬´ double ¬ª bed kept separating which made it difficult to sleep comfortably near my partner as I was always on the gap.,Old, could use some renovation,The lighting was a bit dated. This made the feel of the room a bit gloomy.,Booked double bed but received two pushed together.Booked parking space for ‚Ç¨29 a night,on arrival someone placed his car between the lines and my car did not fit in to the last space.Was offered another space in different level at the exit with such a narrow and sharp entrance where scratched my car in a wall.Wanted to have bath wasn‚Äôt enough hot water for half bath.Was waiting for 2-3 hours to have hot water again.,We had a limited amount of hot water and no one advised us so the water got cold when we were showering.

The stairs and building was a little confusing to navigate.,Nothing to mention.,Possibly too may steps out of reception, it didn't affect us, but might be a problem for less able guests (or was there a lift we missed?),Housekeeping was slightly odd. You go out for the day and the housekeepers come in and clean/tidy your room. Room was well cleaned, beds made, however we had 2 bins in our room and sometimes only one bin would be emptied while the other bin had rubbish still in it. Changed our pillows for whatever reason. Dressing gown provided were used by myself and I would semi fold it or leave it over something and it would get moved into the pile of clothes and just left. Other things like that. It was odd,The bus trip (Route 351) from CDG to the hotel was horrendous.

A bit on the pricy side but normal for this area in Paris.,the fact that I could talk to the next room through the walls‚Ä¶,no bowls in the kitchenette or dishwashing detergent,A hotel needs to respect the patrons and should not take chances by allocating unused and dirty rooms to patrons. The breakfast is not value for money,The underground car park is impossibly tight. I scratched my wheels going in and going out. I strongly recommend parking on the street instead (there were available spaces when we were there).,Our room location!!! We were the last door before you went out into the courtyard. All the lobby noise and door to courtyard at all hours. Rather annoying.,We had the identical breakfast for all 8 mornings,a little too far from sights we wanted to see,they can add a small bench in the small garden.
clean up the stairs and vacuum better.,Breakfast could be better, because during my visit it was a very average spread of ready-to-eat stuff with a little portion of egg & meat. Would be great if they can add more directions for reaching the rooms - because it was so confusing.,Room was a bit on the small side but in Paris it is to be expected.,The lighting in the room is a bit dim. The drain lever is hard to press.,The hotel rooms are a bit old.,On day the cleaners left our door open with the key in the door. We were out all day & was really disappointed. We could have lost a lot of personal items.,Room too small for comfort. Staff didn't assist with advice or recommendations but were polite.,The rooms are ok but could do with upgrading soon

So that was useless.,The fire alarm on the one evening and lack of information available but realise it was difficult to manage. Also not much room to live in the breakfast area - take out one table and stagger the timings more.,Rooms on the smaller side,The lift is very small! And the steps are very narrow but I personally wasn't travelling with a lot of bags so it didn't impact me much. And I couldn't stream to the TV,Nothing,The room was small,Because I had a twin attic room, once off the elevator I needed to do a bit of maneuvering to access the separate floors.,Nothing.,I knew the room was small so that wasnt a surprise. But it was small.,No standing shower, just a European bath and shower handle situation.,Entrance not very appealing.,Nothing to complain!,The safe is basically inaccessible for anyone over aged 30 or taller than a metre! 
In room 11 the lights from the dining room area stayed on every night until midnight. The light shines into the room above the curtain rail and makes it hard to sleep.,One night the music from the bar below was very loud.,The decor is a little eccentric for my liking.,Nothing!,Two things were a bit annoying to me but that's because I'm very claustrophobic: the elevator is very narrow, I don't think two people fit in it and the shower had a door that didn't open all the way.,Door couldn‚Äôt be locked,Nothing,No sink by the toilets, safe didn‚Äôt work and room was a bit dark, but all good when you come back for a relaxing night after a long day of sightseeing.,Only complaint is the narrow staircases without elevator to the 6th floor but we were aware ahead of time!,Would suggest it is not a good for people with mobility issues buth otherwise no issues.,Nothing.,N/a,Very small room with a single bed,The shower was just a shower wand in the claw-foot tub and it was hard to use (was a bit leaky too). Also - hard to reach the soap on the wall, so we bought a bottle of shower gel and it was fine.,Breakfast was a little disappointing. Given the hotel is located near several lovely bakeries, we were surprised the rolls and pastries were not better quality.,The bathtub/shower with our room. But everyone else was sooooo good it wasn‚Äôt a problemj,N A,A Parisian lift in this vintage of hotel is not good for anyone claustrophobic,It was a little too tight,Our room was on first floor at it was noisy at night with noise from street, pub music and people shouting. Not hotels fault.,Room was a little tight but had everything you needed.,Access to upper floors can be challenging as the lift only goes to the 04th floor. Carrying a case up the very narrow stairs to the 05th or 06th floor requires some dexterity.,Our room was on the 5th floor so it was a bit challenging as the elevator only went to the fourth & we had to take a tight twisty stairway, but it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a protected building & they can‚Äôt change the architecture. We managed & staff carried our luggage as needed.,As I was traveling with a friend, wish there was a blind or curtain to block the window in the bathroom that looks right into the shower‚Ä¶,I cannot think of anything I would criticize - the hotel is enchanting, the staff delightful.,It was a little bit noisy at night because the street is allways crowded and the cafes are open till midnight i think,Some strange noise coming somewhere from a machine on and off every now and then. The view was a bit sad and the room was small. The lighting in the bathroom was bad.,Lack of drawer space and only 1 seat,The rooms were really small but I understand it‚Äôs typical to Paris","perfectly located. very friendly and helpful staff. comfortable bed. great shower.,Located right next to a subway entrance, and you can take that subway line to some of the major tourist attractions.,The staff was amazing!

Elias at front desk so helpful and interested to maximise our experience,The hotel and room were very cosy and perfect for a 3 day break in Paris.

The receptionist was very nice and welcoming, he gave me a long list of recommendations of places to eat in the area I tried a few of his suggestions and was pleased.,10/10 for Mozes who is the floormanager at the property.

Central to both the 3rd & 4th districts with St Paul metro just outside the hotel.,Location, friendly staff, comfortable room.,This boutique hotel is delightful. The staff. nothing but attentive and helpful. The room full of nice amenities and cleaned daily. We were in the 2nd floor, courtyard view - the stairs are quircky (it is Paris, after all), but there is an elevator. The building is secure and the Metro is truly right outside the door. Being in the middle of the Marais we expected noisy evenings, but could not hear a thing. We didn't partake of the breakfast offering, so cannot review that.

"295 Avenue Daumesnil, 12th arr., 75012 Paris, France",Motel One Paris-Porte Dor√©e,"Nothing. It's perfect!,Honestly, nothing! The staff was great, they even accommodated me for a room with a view of the Eiffel tower. Staff was so friendly, food breakfast clean rooms,Room was very small, with only a little amount of space to walk around the bed and not much space to the side of the room once you bring in luggage.,Everything was excellent,Nothing really to complain.,The fact they didn‚Äôt serve dinner,The property could have improved if there are more facilities in the room. For example, there was no fridge. There was no iron and ironing board. There was no kettle where you could make yourself a hot drink, which I think is normally standard in most hotels, but apart from those facilities that were lacking in the room, my experience at this hotel was lovely,Kettle/fridge would have been nice to have.,Not much, only comment would be that the room might be too small for someone that planned on staying in the hotel for long hours but perfect if you‚Äôre going to be out for most of the time,1. Everything was great . The only thing that would add more value is, to add a fridge in the room sometime in the future. There is no option to keep in room anything apart from solid foods that do not need freezer. This is kind of important , considering that the hotel does not offer lunch or dinner so there may be times that you need to pick some things up from the market. ( this is basically for long day stays, otherwise for 2-3 days anyone can live without fridge I suppose :) )
2. Location is close to metro which is perfect, however if it‚Äôs your first time in Paris and you want to walk instead of using transportation, prepare yourself for some long walks as 12th apartment is not very close to 3,4,5 apartments which are the coolest, as far as I am concerned,Room is a bit small,The location was a little far out from the main centre of Paris,Nothing,Breakfast... Not great if you have dietary restrictions,Potential to serve lunch and dinner instead of just toasties. Warm foods served at breakfast.,I had nothing to complain about! I will search for this brand in every country where it is present. It has very good RPC and much better than expected for a 3* hotel. Congrats!,It was extremely hot inside, both the lobby and the room. The thermostat wasn‚Äôt working in our room and the window only opened a small amount and it really was quite stifling. Our trip was short and we were out all day so didn‚Äôt ask anyone to look at it but I‚Äôm certain if I did the staff would have done everything they could to fix it.,I found the storage space was slightly limited (but I do have a tendency to over pack!) 
View of the busy road. 
No glasses in room.,No device to boil water,Nothing,Nothing much, but I feel as a service from the hotel, to at least have a shuttle to pick you up at the point, if you get there by train from the airport. It will make the experience much better otherwise I do not have complaints as they are very helpful.,All was fantastic,Nothing really,no fridge ..no coffee making facilities. although this seems standard in europe,Location is a little far out and breakfast was quite expensive, but overall an excellent stay,View on the very high traffic highway
Not much space in the room for dressing,Everything was perfect,Tight space in the room, no room for second chair,Slightly pricey,Nothing, everything was great,Small room; no washcloths and that breakfast was not included in the price. (As we experienced in Germany - with similar buffet and lower price/night),Price they told us there was different than normal price we checked online,Although close to the metro, it‚Äôs a bit far from most tourist attractions and it could take 45 minutes to an hour. If you aren‚Äôt into long distance, it may be a challenge. But the hotel itself, is excellent,We were very happy.,Room was a bit small and. Not much room to layout two suitcases,Front facade of the hotel is industrial and immediate area outside trafficked by cars so a little noisy and not as walkable as I'd expect for Paris (think Grand Army Plaza Brooklyn) and few upscale food options nearby for lunch or dinner (simple brasserie and takeout options). I was the only solo traveller in 20s-30s range as well, was more older couples and families during my stay,There were no negatives from my point of view.,Only issue was that is was so difficult to find any English program, and we unfortunately couldn‚Äôt AirPlay our phones to the tv.,Slightly far from the centre of Paris.,Nothing it was great,The rooms were clean bed was comfortable. Location is in good area though it was far from city,Nothing,Nothing,Limited food and drink choices.,Just a bit far from city centre,Location, not close to the center. BUT very close to public transportation and easy to travel around.,Expensive, thought i understand it is Paris,The room was a bit small, no fridge in the room and a bit far from central.","The best h√¥tel in Paris for qualit√© and Price! Location is amazing with wonderful views of bois de Vincennes, m√©tro, tram, bus stations everywhere around you. The area is very safe and calm and the local eateries are wonderful. 

The minute you enter the hotel, you are transported to a world of style and comfort. The reception in itself is a masterpiece of elegance and a very cozy atmosphere.
 
H√¥tel staff are always welcoming and helpful, the rooms are spacious, impeccable, comfortable and stylish with lovely turquoise accents and artwork everywhere (even the carpets)! 

The breakfast is fresh and delicious with lots of wonderful French pastry options, an all-in-one hot drinks machine, and a generous selection of tea, cheeses, cold cuts, fruits, yogurts, spreads, salad and fresh juices.

I feel at home whenever I visit Motel One Porte Dor√©e and it really feels like home!

Thank you!,The location is great, cause while it's not really centric it's extremely close to a metro station. The area is clean and calm, with nice restaurants around. I would recommend this place.,The location was great for metro and great shops,Property was clean and tidy, excellent location for getting the metro into the centre with some very good restaurants nearby.,Room and building very clean,Very polite stuff, well connected to the centre of Paris. The room was very clean and comfortable and the price quite normal for Paris standards. Would surely stay ther again.,Our room was lovely and cozy. It was conveniently located by the transportation system that took it to the city center. We enjoyed our stay and would come again.,It was great; the bed was very confortable,The staff were very helpful and friendly, the room was perfectly cleaned everyday,I love that location was near a metro station, but it‚Äôs still had its own type of city vibe. For example, they were nice restaurants that were local if you didn‚Äôt want to go and travel out of the city or town.

I liked the atmosphere as well, and the staff were extremely friendly helpful if you ever needed anything,The location is great for a short metro trip to anywhere in Paris. The bar is fantastic, good vibes and music and the most incredible chairs!! So many chairs. 

Lovely breakfast. Highly recommend. 

I would like to make a special mention to all the staff, they are so happy, friendly and kind. Really 10/10,Everything was swift. Swift check-in, swift check-out. Room was clean to a great standard.

Motel was located near metro and tram stops.,The staff is incredible and the location is quite convenient for using metro. Really good hotel for its price.,It is very close to the Porte Doree Palace and Zoo Park Paris, and it is easy to reach from Metro nr. 8 (pink). It is very quiet and clean, and it is a pleasant atmosphere to relax after a day of walking in Paris. The receptionist was very gentle! He deserves an 11 from 10!,The lobby is fantastic, beautiful setting and value for money considering it‚Äôs on the edge of the peripherique.,Very clean and modern hotel. Lovely staff and facilities. A little out of the city but still a nice neighborhood to walk around in. Chose this as a last night place to sleep before an early morning flight. Perfect location from the airport, but only a 15min train from the heart of Paris. Excellent value for money. Would recommend.,Good location, 5 minutes away from metro so can easily get into the city centre. The area felt very safe and clean. Free, fast WiFi. Staff were very friendly, helpful, and welcoming.,The staff were great, the drinks were lovely and so was the room!,Modern, very nice lobby, great staff, offered us the room we asked for,Very good stuff.every thing is good,The 12th arr is close to some attractions and far from others depending where you want to be, but if you want to know what Paris is like on a daily basis, then the 12th Porto Doree, is perfect. The restaurants are close by and reasonable with authentic French food. The hotel provides you with restaurants to go to. It is close to a metro, bus stops and taxis whenever you need it.,Everything was excellent! It‚Äôs also in a nice part of Paris,Hotel was fantastic. Lovely staff and rooms.,The room first seemed a bit small, but not really actually. Everything is here and it is comfortable.
Even if the hotel is located on the edge of Paris, a metro station is not far (more or less five minutes walk).

Extremely comfortable sheets! Highly recommended for value seekers who don't mind commuting into the city center during their stay,The location in the Eastern part of Paris is good, next to a lovely park. Food markets are plenty in the neighbourhood. With the nearby metro, the sights of Paris are easily accessible. The room was very clean and up to the high standard of Motel One.

"70 Bis, Boulevard Ornano, 18th arr., 75018 Paris, France",ibis Paris Ornano Montmartre Nord 18√®me,"Nothing,Not much to criticise at all - perhaps a kettle/the chance to have a hot drink in the room would've added some extra comfort.,N/a,It would be great if there was a bin both in the toilet and in the main living space. Apart from that it was great.,Room service didn‚Äôt work , Tv remote was faulty,English of the receptionists should be better in a primarily touristic hotel. The vicinity of the hotel seems not very safe at night but we had no problems.,Breakfast was not great. But it was okey,Rooms little,The price didn't reflect how far out of the city it was. The neighbourhood was quite rough, we didn't feel safe to walk outside at night.,The area. If you turn left out of the hotel and walk 5-10 mins towards the Sacre Coeur, it's becomes lovely and just like the 'Paris' or 'France' you picture... if you turn right it is like the ghetto, with pick pockets and rough people. You need to be very careful with your bags and personal belongings.,Breakfast area is currently under construction and builders were using the facilities so often there was no coffee left in machine. Not enough seating, no matter what time we chose we had to wait ot share a table.,Breakfast could have been better. Felt quite limited option wise,It was pretty basic and some facilities could do with refurbishment,Only a small comment, but the carpets on the stairs were very dirty.,Small rooms and shower,Not a great Area we were a bit intimidated by,Lady receptionist is good , staff good Better if washroom was big enough and atleast kettle in a room which is advertised on site . Rest everything is good,The bathroom was very small. I stayed for a night. Next day morning I slept in a bit late as I had a long journey ahead of me. I heard so much noise of someone cleaning constantly that I couldn't sleep. There was literally zero sound control. Based on this, I am guessing if someone had the tv on next door, it would be equivalent to me watching tv.,The breakfast was the same for every morning,without fruits or veggies,most of the vessel was dirty as unwashed,very small place for eating,tables near toilet.In the room,the floor was not cleaned daily.,The room was very very small. The cleaning personnel cane everyday, and took the used towels but didn‚Äôt gave new ones to replace, after asking for it they gave it tho.,Room was quite small
A bit of a rough location,Room was quite small,Cramped bathroom,The horrible area and room could be cleaner.,A little cramped but after all, this is Paris so it was to be expected.,Room was small,Price was bit high,The area that this hotel is in is not safe. Constant police presence in the area, a lot of undesirables.,Rooms were Small / compact. And Area a bit busier than we expected.,Location quite far from Monmarte and in not such a nice area.,The room we stayed in has got one of the smallest bathrooms I've ever been to, and I've been through several.
STAY away from any room that is numbered 1; i.e 101 201 501...etc. Unless you want to hug the shower while you are using the toilet or water the floor while using the sink.

The staff are not helpful, though they were nice; i.e. not rude. But unhelpful. They are way more strict in the check-in and check-out times that any other ibis hotels in Paris or others in Europe. And for sure even more than other 2 or 3 star hotels that I've been through across Europe. And they are not that full to begin with.

There was no enough room or silverware or plates to accommodate the residences during breakfast.

The location itself not close to attractions, yet not far. The neighborhood is a ""getto"" neighborhood, for a lack of better word, but that may not be an issue in itself but FYI.

It was around 10 euros difference in terms of price than other ibis hotels in Paris, definitely not worth the decreased price.,Bathroom should have a division between the shower and the toilet, all the time we try to take a bath it was very difficult because the water was splitting all over the floor, and it was impossible to enter to the bathroom without shoes. Also, neighborhood where hotel is located is not safer after certain hours, it should be considered if you like to arrive late at night. And to finalize, breakfast is very simple, it should have more variety.,Room need to be little bigger,Although is 2 min walking to a metro station that takes you everywhere, it didn‚Äôt feel the safest place at night and early morning. Especially for a solo female traveler. Price was a bit too much considering what I mention above, but I get that you‚Äôre paying fir the closeness to metro station. 
Reception staff speak poorly or none English. It was hard communicating and requesting something with some of them. I personally think that every hotel should hire bilingual people for improving hotel service to guests. 12 euros for the breakfast they serve, I think it‚Äôs a little too much. Might be 10 or even 8.,Room was very small compared to ones shown in photos. Breakfast was quite poor.,The breakfast had nice food but was not well organized.,The rooms were quite warm for us. We could not really adjust the temperature so we slept we the windows open (which was fine for us but could be an issue for somebody else).,Everything was fine. I have no complaints!,Nothing comes to mind.,There was a problem with the sink but it was fast repaired. The toilet seat was weirdly position, so close and face to the wall, it was not easy for a short person so i cant imagine for a tall person. You might see 1-2 homeless people near the hotel and drunk people late at night.,small room,Breakfast was very minimal,Breakfast was OK (quality and variety) but one has to ask the personnel when something is finished.,no issues,The neighborhood is not the nicest,The breakfast was disappointing. For two days, the coffee machine did not work. It seems that this is a recurrent problem. The ventilation system in the accommodation was too noisy, so we shut it down. It was warm, so we left the door of the balcony open, despite the noise from street.,Breakfast is not available until the proposed time. And when you ask for it, they will answer stating ""stock not available"". Service is not extrememy good. Better book for option without breakfast.,There were some cleanliness issues that I guess just don't get considered - like cobwebs and dirty skirting boards. My room looked out on the courtyard (which is not as grand as the description makes out) and it meant that when teenagers were staying and decided to shout across the rooms, it echoed. This wasn't helpful to me having come to run the Paris Marathon. Though the description says ""soundproof"", I think this relates to just elements of the room. Even with the windows shut, I could hear the courtyard, and all walking/conversation in the corridor was heard loudly, and doors banged shaking the room. I had chosen a hotel as it would be less disruptive than a hostel, but clearly there are issues with it being an old building. Also would have appreciated a kettle, but that's how they make additional money right.,Breakfast is very limited...,See above,Small rooms, but larger than others in the area.,Breakfast was from 6-10am. Me & friends arrived at 9am but as hotel was full there was nothing left.
